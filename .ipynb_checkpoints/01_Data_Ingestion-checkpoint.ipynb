An identified industry challenge is ensuring post-market surveillance of AI at scale, providing a foundation for the continued clinical safety and improvement of algorithms before and after clinical deployment. AI algorithms already need to meet high-performance standards for clearance by notified bodies such as the FDA.Dr. Martin Willemink, MD PhD, CEO Segmed, John Moulden, CCO deepc, Dr. Anna Tidstam, CTO, deepc, and Erik Duhaime, CEO Centaur Labs. (PRNewsfoto/Deepc)(PRNewswire)However, in some clinical scenarios, the performance of an AI algorithm may not meet expectations or degrade over time, e.g. due to different target patient populations or new scanner types. To identify such effects immediately, it is crucial to assess the performance of AI before and during its deployment in routine clinical use. In such cases, AI algorithms can then be re-trained on broader datasets, reflecting the target population, and making them more robust and safe. To address this need, deepc, Centaur Labs, and Segmed have joined forces and started a Radiology AI Safety Initiative to strengthen the continued AI performance in clinical workflows.Three leaders in the field of Radiology AI have formed a novel AI Safety initiative to make AI algorithm use in clinical routines safer, as well as management and retraining easier.MedTech company deepc with its leading radiology AI platform deepcOS offers radiologists access to a myriad of regulatory-cleared AI solutions from their globally leading partner network.Segmed provides secured, de-identified medical data, and Centaur Labs a labeling solution for such data.Collaborating with its AI Partners, deepc helps AI applications fulfill the highest safety and performance standards.Customers that use deepcOS commonly seek validation and benchmarking assistance to identify the optimal performance of algorithms and pre-launch safety checks, offering surety of selection meeting the specific needs of the clinical environment.Segmed's self-serve data platform Insight allows AI developers to build cohorts of de-identified and structured data that are readily available for training, testing, and validation of AI algorithms.Together with Centaur Labs, medical labeling services can be provided for given clinical indication fields to ensure safe operations of AI engines on specific customer data prior to deployment.The companies are developing a joint offering. AI vendors will be able to perform real-time post-market surveillance via the deepcOS platform and identify when an AI model is performing suboptimally over time, a phenomenon that is often regarded as 'AI drift'. This may be caused by a shifting patient population or new scanner types, for instance. deepc will avail this precise information to AI vendor partners and offer on-demand access to data that is anonymized and cleared for AI R&amp;D through Segmed's data platform, and annotated by Centaur Lab's scalable data annotation platform. This data can be used to retrain the AI algorithm, improve performance, robustness, and clinical AI safety. Obtaining diverse, relevant data and labeling this data are two of the biggest bottlenecks in AI pipelines, solved by deepc's partners Segmed and Centaur Labs.\"An outstanding effort of our companies leads to improved clinical AI safety, eventually leading to better clinical outcomes and increased patient safety. We are very proud to be leading this very important initiative in the industry\", says deepc's Co-Founder and CEO Dr. Franz Pfister.Find more insights here: https://www.deepc.ai/news/ensuring-clinical-ai-safety-at-scalPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1958826/Deepc__DR.jpgPress contact:Natalie ErdmannCMOnatalie.erdmann@deepc.aiwww.deepc.aiLinkedIn/company/deepchealthView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ensuring-clinical-ai-safety-at-scale-deepc-centaur-labs-and-segmed-form-radiology-ai-safety-initiative-301690247.htmlSOURCE  DeepcThe above press release was provided courtesy of PRNewswire.

An identified industry challenge is ensuring post-market surveillance of AI at scale, providing a foundation for the continued clinical safety and improvement of algorithms before and after clinical deployment. AI algorithms already need to meet high-performance standards for clearance by notified bodies such as the FDA.Dr. Martin Willemink, MD PhD, CEO Segmed, John Moulden, CCO deepc, Dr. Anna Tidstam, CTO, deepc, and Erik Duhaime, CEO Centaur Labs. (PRNewsfoto/Deepc)(PRNewswire)However, in some clinical scenarios, the performance of an AI algorithm may not meet expectations or degrade over time, e.g. due to different target patient populations or new scanner types. To identify such effects immediately, it is crucial to assess the performance of AI before and during its deployment in routine clinical use. In such cases, AI algorithms can then be re-trained on broader datasets, reflecting the target population, and making them more robust and safe. To address this need, deepc, Centaur Labs, and Segmed have joined forces and started a Radiology AI Safety Initiative to strengthen the continued AI performance in clinical workflows.Three leaders in the field of Radiology AI have formed a novel AI Safety initiative to make AI algorithm use in clinical routines safer, as well as management and retraining easier.MedTech company deepc with its leading radiology AI platform deepcOS offers radiologists access to a myriad of regulatory-cleared AI solutions from their globally leading partner network.Segmed provides secured, de-identified medical data, and Centaur Labs a labeling solution for such data.Collaborating with its AI Partners, deepc helps AI applications fulfill the highest safety and performance standards.Customers that use deepcOS commonly seek validation and benchmarking assistance to identify the optimal performance of algorithms and pre-launch safety checks, offering surety of selection meeting the specific needs of the clinical environment.Segmed's self-serve data platform Insight allows AI developers to build cohorts of de-identified and structured data that are readily available for training, testing, and validation of AI algorithms.Together with Centaur Labs, medical labeling services can be provided for given clinical indication fields to ensure safe operations of AI engines on specific customer data prior to deployment.The companies are developing a joint offering. AI vendors will be able to perform real-time post-market surveillance via the deepcOS platform and identify when an AI model is performing suboptimally over time, a phenomenon that is often regarded as 'AI drift'. This may be caused by a shifting patient population or new scanner types, for instance. deepc will avail this precise information to AI vendor partners and offer on-demand access to data that is anonymized and cleared for AI R&D through Segmed's data platform, and annotated by Centaur Lab's scalable data annotation platform. This data can be used to retrain the AI algorithm, improve performance, robustness, and clinical AI safety. Obtaining diverse, relevant data and labeling this data are two of the biggest bottlenecks in AI pipelines, solved by deepc's partners Segmed and Centaur Labs.\"An outstanding effort of our companies leads to improved clinical AI safety, eventually leading to better clinical outcomes and increased patient safety. We are very proud to be leading this very important initiative in the industry\", says deepc's Co-Founder and CEO Dr. Franz Pfister.Find more insights here: https://www.deepc.ai/news/ensuring-clinical-ai-safety-at-scalPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1958826/Deepc__DR.jpgPress contact:Natalie ErdmannCMOnatalie.erdmann@deepc.aiwww.deepc.aiLinkedIn/company/deepchealthView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ensuring-clinical-ai-safety-at-scale-deepc-centaur-labs-and-segmed-form-radiology-ai-safety-initiative-301690247.htmlSOURCE  DeepcThe above press release was provided courtesy of PRNewswire.

Expanding on the popular MyGroup feature — which enables patrons of the Masters digital platforms to watch every shot, on every hole, from all their favorite players — the AI commentary solution will produce detailed golf narration for more than 20,000 video clips over the course of the Tournament. It is the latest example of how IBM and the Masters are working together to create digital fan experiences that offer unparalleled access and in-depth insights into every moment of the Tournament, from the first drive on the first tee to the final putt on the 18th green. \\n\\nExperts from IBM iX, the experience design partner within IBM Consulting, worked with the Masters digital team to leverage multiple foundation models — including IBM Watson Text-to-Speech – to train the AI in the unique language of golf at the Masters, automating the process of adding spoken commentary to video clips. Generative AI built on foundation models was applied to produce narration with varied sentence structure and vocabulary, avoiding redundant play-by-play iterations to make the clips informative and engaging.\\nAlso new to the Tournament this year, IBM will introduce hole-by-hole player predictions. To project a player’s score on each hole for the entire Tournament, the IBM Consulting team leveraged AutoAI capabilities in IBM Watson Studio to train AI models using six years of Masters data — more than 120,000 golf shots. After the completion of a given hole, the hole-by-hole projections are updated to reflect the most recent performance of the player. The new solution expands on the predictive intelligence of the popular Players Insights and Masters Fantasy Projections feature, which turns data into insights around the most exciting holes to watch for every golfer, the low/high score for all golfers, and projected Masters Fantasy points for every round.\\n“For more than twenty years, IBM and the Masters have partnered together to create custom solutions that improve the user experience and capture the attention of millions of golf fans globally,” said Jonathan Adashek, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications for IBM. “We’re applying the same hybrid cloud, AI technology and IBM Consulting services that we use with clients across industries to bring an elevated digital experience to one of the most iconic sporting events in the world.”\\nTimed to this year’s Tournament, IBM will launch the next iteration of its “Let’s create” brand initiative, “What if?”. Conceptualized and executed by Ogilvy, “What if?” underscores the importance of asking big questions that can lead to the creation of equally big technology solutions. The spots were filmed by ProdCo’s Ian Pons Jewell, featuring Golden Globe-winning and Emmy-nominated actor and producer Oscar Isaac as the voice over interacting with people in each scene. One installment of the four distinct ads includes rising golfer and 87th Masters Tournament invitee Kurt Kitayama and sports commentator Jim Nantz, who bring this creative concept to life through the lens of IBM’s collaborative partnership with the Masters. In addition to the Masters, the campaign is inspired by IBM’s work with a range of clients across sustainability, supply chain, and data analytics and security, demonstrating how IBM is helping organizations drive innovation, transformation, and enhanced customer experiences. The campaign begins April 5 across broadcast, connected TV, digital video, print and social.\\nIBM has been the digital partner of the Masters for more than 25 years, working closely to bring unparalleled experiences to the global Masters audience. Starting with the launch of Masters.com in 1996, the Masters has collaborated with IBM on a journey to the hybrid cloud to streamline workloads and deliver new fan experiences through cloud and AI technologies. The implementation of that technology has been showcased continually, including through the introduction of AI Highlights, Round in Under Three Minutes, MyGroup, Player Insights and Projections powered with IBM Watson.\\nThe 87th Masters Tournament will be played from April 6-9 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, GA.

The project aims to benefit 13.000 ha of farm area in India in the next two years.\\nShrimp diseases cause significant economic losses. The Asian shrimp industry alone reported to have lost at least US$20 billion in a decade. Diseases in the State of Andhra Pradesh that constitutes of nearly 70 per cent of Indian shrimp production are expected to cut down production by 40 per cent this year. Diseases have economic, social and environmental consequences as natural resources such as shrimp feed etc are wasted.\\nAquaconnect helps Indian shrimp farmers to manage their farm operations efficiently and improving productivity by using artificial intelligence. Aquaconnect’s FarmMOJO mobile app uses machine learning technology to analyse feed and growth patterns in relation to animal health. The app provides insights to the farmers and suggests appropriate advice for better disease management.\\nRajamanohar, CEO, Aquaconnect said, “The Government of India is ramping up support for the aquaculture sector, launching the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) to catalyse Blue Revolution 2.0. We are excited to partner with IDH and Prof. Kenton Morgan on pioneering the machine learning efforts in shrimp epidemiology studies to help the Indian farmers to mitigate the risks due to diseases and support long term sustainability of this Industry “\\nAquaconnect aims to enhance FarmMOJO’s disease prediction model by using Aquatic Epidemiology, provided by Prof. Kenton Morgan. Professor Kenton Morgan, University of Liverpool has over 40 years of experience in epidemiology. The IDH Aquaculture Program aims to link aquatic epidemiology to the sector. IDH supports and pilots the linkage in several geographies as to tackle feed and disease issues.\\nFlavio Corsin, Program Director – Aquaculture at IDH, Sustainable Trade Initiative and a trained aquatic epidemiologist said, ‘’Shrimp farming practices and environment change continuously, and these changes can affect disease occurrence in complex and unpredictable ways. Integrating epidemiological tools into Aquaconnect’s farm management app will allow farmers to benefit from Artificial Intelligence in their efforts to understand, predict and prevent diseases’’.\\nIf you have an interesting article / experience / case study to share, please get in touch with us at [email protected]ronline.comAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nAquaconnectAquacultureBlue Revolution 2.0FarmMOJOKenton MorganPMMSYPradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada YojanaShrimp \\n\\n\\n 0 4 \\n\\n\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\nGet real time updates directly on you device, subscribe now.\\nSubscribe\\n\\nExpress Computer\\nExpress Computer is one of India's most respected IT media brands and has been in publication for 24 years running.

The project aims to benefit 13.000 ha of farm area in India in the next two years.Shrimp diseases cause significant economic losses. The Asian shrimp industry alone reported to have lost at least US$20 billion in a decade. Diseases in the State of Andhra Pradesh that constitutes of nearly 70 per cent of Indian shrimp production are expected to cut down production by 40 per cent this year. Diseases have economic, social and environmental consequences as natural resources such as shrimp feed etc are wasted.Aquaconnect helps Indian shrimp farmers to manage their farm operations efficiently and improving productivity by using artificial intelligence. Aquaconnect’s FarmMOJO mobile app uses machine learning technology to analyse feed and growth patterns in relation to animal health. The app provides insights to the farmers and suggests appropriate advice for better disease management.Rajamanohar, CEO, Aquaconnect said, “The Government of India is ramping up support for the aquaculture sector, launching the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) to catalyse Blue Revolution 2.0. We are excited to partner with IDH and Prof. Kenton Morgan on pioneering the machine learning efforts in shrimp epidemiology studies to help the Indian farmers to mitigate the risks due to diseases and support long term sustainability of this Industry “Aquaconnect aims to enhance FarmMOJO’s disease prediction model by using Aquatic Epidemiology, provided by Prof. Kenton Morgan. Professor Kenton Morgan, University of Liverpool has over 40 years of experience in epidemiology. The IDH Aquaculture Program aims to link aquatic epidemiology to the sector. IDH supports and pilots the linkage in several geographies as to tackle feed and disease issues.Flavio Corsin, Program Director – Aquaculture at IDH, Sustainable Trade Initiative and a trained aquatic epidemiologist said, ‘’Shrimp farming practices and environment change continuously, and these changes can affect disease occurrence in complex and unpredictable ways. Integrating epidemiological tools into Aquaconnect’s farm management app will allow farmers to benefit from Artificial Intelligence in their efforts to understand, predict and prevent diseases’’.If you have an interesting article / experience / case study to share, please get in touch with us at [email protected]ronline.comAdvertisement AquaconnectAquacultureBlue Revolution 2.0FarmMOJOKenton MorganPMMSYPradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada YojanaShrimp  0 4  Share Get real time updates directly on you device, subscribe now.SubscribeExpress ComputerExpress Computer is one of India's most respected IT media brands and has been in publication for 24 years running.

Expanding on the popular MyGroup feature — which enables patrons of the Masters digital platforms to watch every shot, on every hole, from all their favorite players — the AI commentary solution will produce detailed golf narration for more than 20,000 video clips over the course of the Tournament. It is the latest example of how IBM and the Masters are working together to create digital fan experiences that offer unparalleled access and in-depth insights into every moment of the Tournament, from the first drive on the first tee to the final putt on the 18th green. \\n\\nExperts from IBM iX, the experience design partner within IBM Consulting, worked with the Masters digital team to leverage multiple foundation models — including IBM Watson Text-to-Speech – to train the AI in the unique language of golf at the Masters, automating the process of adding spoken commentary to video clips. Generative AI built on foundation models was applied to produce narration with varied sentence structure and vocabulary, avoiding redundant play-by-play iterations to make the clips informative and engaging.\\nAlso new to the Tournament this year, IBM will introduce hole-by-hole player predictions. To project a player’s score on each hole for the entire Tournament, the IBM Consulting team leveraged AutoAI capabilities in IBM Watson Studio to train AI models using six years of Masters data — more than 120,000 golf shots. After the completion of a given hole, the hole-by-hole projections are updated to reflect the most recent performance of the player. The new solution expands on the predictive intelligence of the popular Players Insights and Masters Fantasy Projections feature, which turns data into insights around the most exciting holes to watch for every golfer, the low/high score for all golfers, and projected Masters Fantasy points for every round.\\n“For more than twenty years, IBM and the Masters have partnered together to create custom solutions that improve the user experience and capture the attention of millions of golf fans globally,” said Jonathan Adashek, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications for IBM. “We’re applying the same hybrid cloud, AI technology and IBM Consulting services that we use with clients across industries to bring an elevated digital experience to one of the most iconic sporting events in the world.”\\nTimed to this year’s Tournament, IBM will launch the next iteration of its “Let’s create” brand initiative, “What if?”. Conceptualized and executed by Ogilvy, “What if?” underscores the importance of asking big questions that can lead to the creation of equally big technology solutions. The spots were filmed by ProdCo’s Ian Pons Jewell, featuring Golden Globe-winning and Emmy-nominated actor and producer Oscar Isaac as the voice over interacting with people in each scene. One installment of the four distinct ads includes rising golfer and 87th Masters Tournament invitee Kurt Kitayama and sports commentator Jim Nantz, who bring this creative concept to life through the lens of IBM’s collaborative partnership with the Masters. In addition to the Masters, the campaign is inspired by IBM’s work with a range of clients across sustainability, supply chain, and data analytics and security, demonstrating how IBM is helping organizations drive innovation, transformation, and enhanced customer experiences. The campaign begins April 5 across broadcast, connected TV, digital video, print and social.\\nIBM has been the digital partner of the Masters for more than 25 years, working closely to bring unparalleled experiences to the global Masters audience. Starting with the launch of Masters.com in 1996, the Masters has collaborated with IBM on a journey to the hybrid cloud to streamline workloads and deliver new fan experiences through cloud and AI technologies. The implementation of that technology has been showcased continually, including through the introduction of AI Highlights, Round in Under Three Minutes, MyGroup, Player Insights and Projections powered with IBM Watson.\\nThe 87th Masters Tournament will be played from April 6-9 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, GA.

The project aims to benefit 13.000 ha of farm area in India in the next two years.\\nShrimp diseases cause significant economic losses. The Asian shrimp industry alone reported to have lost at least US$20 billion in a decade. Diseases in the State of Andhra Pradesh that constitutes of nearly 70 per cent of Indian shrimp production are expected to cut down production by 40 per cent this year. Diseases have economic, social and environmental consequences as natural resources such as shrimp feed etc are wasted.\\nAquaconnect helps Indian shrimp farmers to manage their farm operations efficiently and improving productivity by using artificial intelligence. Aquaconnect’s FarmMOJO mobile app uses machine learning technology to analyse feed and growth patterns in relation to animal health. The app provides insights to the farmers and suggests appropriate advice for better disease management.\\nRajamanohar, CEO, Aquaconnect said, “The Government of India is ramping up support for the aquaculture sector, launching the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) to catalyse Blue Revolution 2.0. We are excited to partner with IDH and Prof. Kenton Morgan on pioneering the machine learning efforts in shrimp epidemiology studies to help the Indian farmers to mitigate the risks due to diseases and support long term sustainability of this Industry “\\nAquaconnect aims to enhance FarmMOJO’s disease prediction model by using Aquatic Epidemiology, provided by Prof. Kenton Morgan. Professor Kenton Morgan, University of Liverpool has over 40 years of experience in epidemiology. The IDH Aquaculture Program aims to link aquatic epidemiology to the sector. IDH supports and pilots the linkage in several geographies as to tackle feed and disease issues.\\nFlavio Corsin, Program Director – Aquaculture at IDH, Sustainable Trade Initiative and a trained aquatic epidemiologist said, ‘’Shrimp farming practices and environment change continuously, and these changes can affect disease occurrence in complex and unpredictable ways. Integrating epidemiological tools into Aquaconnect’s farm management app will allow farmers to benefit from Artificial Intelligence in their efforts to understand, predict and prevent diseases’’.\\nIf you have an interesting article / experience / case study to share, please get in touch with us at [email protected]ronline.comAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nAquaconnectAquacultureBlue Revolution 2.0FarmMOJOKenton MorganPMMSYPradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada YojanaShrimp \\n\\n\\n 0 4 \\n\\n\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\nGet real time updates directly on you device, subscribe now.\\nSubscribe\\n\\nExpress Computer\\nExpress Computer is one of India's most respected IT media brands and has been in publication for 24 years running.

Expanding on the popular MyGroup feature — which enables patrons of the Masters digital platforms to watch every shot, on every hole, from all their favorite players — the AI commentary solution will produce detailed golf narration for more than 20,000 video clips over the course of the Tournament. It is the latest example of how IBM and the Masters are working together to create digital fan experiences that offer unparalleled access and in-depth insights into every moment of the Tournament, from the first drive on the first tee to the final putt on the 18th green. Experts from IBM iX, the experience design partner within IBM Consulting, worked with the Masters digital team to leverage multiple foundation models — including IBM Watson Text-to-Speech – to train the AI in the unique language of golf at the Masters, automating the process of adding spoken commentary to video clips. Generative AI built on foundation models was applied to produce narration with varied sentence structure and vocabulary, avoiding redundant play-by-play iterations to make the clips informative and engaging.Also new to the Tournament this year, IBM will introduce hole-by-hole player predictions. To project a player’s score on each hole for the entire Tournament, the IBM Consulting team leveraged AutoAI capabilities in IBM Watson Studio to train AI models using six years of Masters data — more than 120,000 golf shots. After the completion of a given hole, the hole-by-hole projections are updated to reflect the most recent performance of the player. The new solution expands on the predictive intelligence of the popular Players Insights and Masters Fantasy Projections feature, which turns data into insights around the most exciting holes to watch for every golfer, the low/high score for all golfers, and projected Masters Fantasy points for every round.“For more than twenty years, IBM and the Masters have partnered together to create custom solutions that improve the user experience and capture the attention of millions of golf fans globally,” said Jonathan Adashek, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications for IBM. “We’re applying the same hybrid cloud, AI technology and IBM Consulting services that we use with clients across industries to bring an elevated digital experience to one of the most iconic sporting events in the world.”Timed to this year’s Tournament, IBM will launch the next iteration of its “Let’s create” brand initiative, “What if?”. Conceptualized and executed by Ogilvy, “What if?” underscores the importance of asking big questions that can lead to the creation of equally big technology solutions. The spots were filmed by ProdCo’s Ian Pons Jewell, featuring Golden Globe-winning and Emmy-nominated actor and producer Oscar Isaac as the voice over interacting with people in each scene. One installment of the four distinct ads includes rising golfer and 87th Masters Tournament invitee Kurt Kitayama and sports commentator Jim Nantz, who bring this creative concept to life through the lens of IBM’s collaborative partnership with the Masters. In addition to the Masters, the campaign is inspired by IBM’s work with a range of clients across sustainability, supply chain, and data analytics and security, demonstrating how IBM is helping organizations drive innovation, transformation, and enhanced customer experiences. The campaign begins April 5 across broadcast, connected TV, digital video, print and social.IBM has been the digital partner of the Masters for more than 25 years, working closely to bring unparalleled experiences to the global Masters audience. Starting with the launch of Masters.com in 1996, the Masters has collaborated with IBM on a journey to the hybrid cloud to streamline workloads and deliver new fan experiences through cloud and AI technologies. The implementation of that technology has been showcased continually, including through the introduction of AI Highlights, Round in Under Three Minutes, MyGroup, Player Insights and Projections powered with IBM Watson.The 87th Masters Tournament will be played from April 6-9 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, GA.

The project aims to benefit 13.000 ha of farm area in India in the next two years.Shrimp diseases cause significant economic losses. The Asian shrimp industry alone reported to have lost at least US$20 billion in a decade. Diseases in the State of Andhra Pradesh that constitutes of nearly 70 per cent of Indian shrimp production are expected to cut down production by 40 per cent this year. Diseases have economic, social and environmental consequences as natural resources such as shrimp feed etc are wasted.Aquaconnect helps Indian shrimp farmers to manage their farm operations efficiently and improving productivity by using artificial intelligence. Aquaconnect’s FarmMOJO mobile app uses machine learning technology to analyse feed and growth patterns in relation to animal health. The app provides insights to the farmers and suggests appropriate advice for better disease management.Rajamanohar, CEO, Aquaconnect said, “The Government of India is ramping up support for the aquaculture sector, launching the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) to catalyse Blue Revolution 2.0. We are excited to partner with IDH and Prof. Kenton Morgan on pioneering the machine learning efforts in shrimp epidemiology studies to help the Indian farmers to mitigate the risks due to diseases and support long term sustainability of this Industry “Aquaconnect aims to enhance FarmMOJO’s disease prediction model by using Aquatic Epidemiology, provided by Prof. Kenton Morgan. Professor Kenton Morgan, University of Liverpool has over 40 years of experience in epidemiology. The IDH Aquaculture Program aims to link aquatic epidemiology to the sector. IDH supports and pilots the linkage in several geographies as to tackle feed and disease issues.Flavio Corsin, Program Director – Aquaculture at IDH, Sustainable Trade Initiative and a trained aquatic epidemiologist said, ‘’Shrimp farming practices and environment change continuously, and these changes can affect disease occurrence in complex and unpredictable ways. Integrating epidemiological tools into Aquaconnect’s farm management app will allow farmers to benefit from Artificial Intelligence in their efforts to understand, predict and prevent diseases’’.If you have an interesting article / experience / case study to share, please get in touch with us at [email protected]ronline.comAdvertisement AquaconnectAquacultureBlue Revolution 2.0FarmMOJOKenton MorganPMMSYPradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada YojanaShrimp  0 4  Share Get real time updates directly on you device, subscribe now.SubscribeExpress ComputerExpress Computer is one of India's most respected IT media brands and has been in publication for 24 years running.
