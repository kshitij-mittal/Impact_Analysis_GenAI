Semi-automated offside technology is to be used for the first time at the FIFA World Cup 2022. The referee and linesmen will now be assisted by a huge number of cameras, and advanced tracking technology that can detect if even the slightest slither of an attacking player is in front of the last defender and therefore OFFSIDE. As you can see from the short gif clip below, and the somewhat longer video at the bottom of this story, this new development of VAR (Video Assistant Referee) works in a very similar way to the existing tech, but now the footie AI detects offsides on its own, and alerts the video officials. Quite what the linesmen think about this, I don't know. They might as well just put their feet up, rather than running up and down with flags, looking like short-sighted idiots.(Image credit: FIFA)VAR hasn't been universally welcomed by soccer lovers, to put it mildly. However, much of the criticism has related to how and when the humans on the pitch choose to use it. With this development, a computer does the work for them. Could this be the beginning of the end for human linesmen, or even the man that fans lovingly call, 'the banker in the black'? We shall see…The VAR tech tracks multiple points of the body(Image credit: FIFA)FIFA says: 'The new technology uses 12 dedicated tracking cameras mounted underneath the roof of the stadium to track the ball and up to 29 data points of each individual player, 50 times per second, calculating their exact position on the pitch. The 29 collected data points include all limbs and extremities that are relevant for making offside calls.'As you no doubt know, the arms and hands are excluded from calculating whether a player is offside. It's not just the players being tracked, however. A sensor inside Adidas' official World Cup match ball also sends data to the video ops room 500 times per second, 'allowing a very precise detection of the kick point.'AI constantly analyses all these data points, and sends an alert to the officials in the VAR room when an offside is detected. Hopefully this alert is 'OFFSIDE DETECTED! OFFSIDE DETECTED! HALT PLAY!' in a Dalek voice.Ref! Offside! Get some new glasses!(Image credit: FIFA)The video guys then make sure the computer hasn't messed up. This part of the process is where there is potential for things to get controversial, I suspect. However, FIFA says it will happen 'within a few seconds', so there will hopefully be no more of that agonising and deeply annoying waiting around for offside decisions to be called. The video officials then notify the hapless buffoon on the pitch, via his earpiece. He then signals that he and his linesmen have yet again missed a blatant offside. After that, everyone gets to see the cool animation that the VAR system has generated, on the stadium's big screen and on the not-quite-so-big screen in your home or at the local sports bar.Though I say 'cool animation', this bit actually looks slightly grotesque(Image credit: FIFA)This system has already been trialled at events including the FIFA Arab Cup and FIFA Club World Cup, so hopefully things will run smoothly. The goal is to then fine-tune the system even further, 'to ensure that the new technology can be used in the world of football.' Although according to FIFA, it already has, so I'm not sure what that's about. What the VAR room officials will see(Image credit: FIFA)Amiable, bulging-eyed slaphead super-ref Pierluigi Collina is now chairman of the FIFA Referees Committee. He reached for his pocket and pulled out this statement: “VAR has already had a very positive impact on football and we can see that the number of major mistakes has already been dramatically reduced. We expect that semi-automated offside technology can take us a step further. We are aware that sometimes the process to check a possible offside takes too long, especially when the offside incident is very tight. This is where semi-automated offside technology comes in – to offer faster and more accurate decisions.”If Offside VAR is okay with Pierluigi, it's fine by us. GOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAL! Oh… Not a goal; VAR confirms it was offside.Further reading: a complete guide to the offside rule (opens in new tab) (from the FA) Duncan Bell Duncan has been writing about tech for almost 15 years and fitness ever since he became middle aged and realised he could no longer rely solely on his boyish good looks. He used to be on telly loads, but an unfortunate incident put a stop to that, so he now largely contents himself with telling people, \"I used to be on the TV, you know.\"  Pre-lockdown Duncan was widely regarded as the best-dressed man ever to work for T3 – admittedly not saying much. Post-lockdown he is looking forward to wearing clothes other than shorts and hoodies again very soon, assuming he can still fit into them. He currently writes about cycling, fitness tech that isn’t too heavy, and all things kitchen and home related.  Latest   Netflix's latest movie joins forces with Waze for new navigation voices New voices are coming to the navigation app for a limited time only By Alistair Charlton • Published 1 July 22 iPhone 14 Pro suddenly looks less appealing New rumor points to price hike By Robert Jones • Published 1 July 22 Useful links Features Amazon Prime Day (opens in new tab) PS5 restock tracker (opens in new tab) Best 5G phones (opens in new tab) Best VPN services (opens in new tab) Top Guides Best laptops (opens in new tab) Best TVs (opens in new tab) Best smartphones (opens in new tab) Best mattresses (opens in new tab) Best Deals Best phone deals (opens in new tab) Best mattress deals (opens in new tab) Best TV deals (opens in new tab) Discount codes (opens in new tab) T3 About Us (opens in new tab)Terms and conditions (opens in new tab)Privacy policy (opens in new tab)Cookies policy (opens in new tab)Accessibility Statement (opens in new tab)Careers (opens in new tab)T3 is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

The company also announced a new integration with NVIDIA Triton Inference Server. These capabilities are particularly focused on supporting organizations in deploying and using AI models for inference workloads on NVIDIA-accelerated computing, so they can provide accurate, real-time responses. The features cement Run:ai Atlas as a single unified platform where AI teams, from data scientists to MLOps engineers, can build, train and manage models in production from one simple interface.AI models can be challenging to deploy into production; despite the time and effort spent to build and train models, most never leave the lab. Configuring a model, connecting it to data and containers, and dedicating only the required amount of compute are major barriers to making AI work in production. Deploying a model usually requires manually editing and loading tedious YAML configuration files. Run:ai's new two-step deployment makes the process easy, enabling organizations to quickly switch between models, optimize for economical use of GPUs, and ensure that models run efficiently in production.Run:ai also announced full integration with NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, which allows organizations to deploy multiple models — or multiple instances of the same model — and run them in parallel within a single container. NVIDIA Triton Inference Server is included in the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, which is fully supported and optimized for AI development and deployment. Run:ai's orchestration works on top of NVIDIA Triton and provides auto-scaling, allocation and prioritization on a per-model basis — which right-sizes Triton automatically. Using Run:ai's Atlas with NVIDIA Triton leads to increased compute resource utilization while simplifying AI infrastructure. The Run.ai Atlas Platform is an NVIDIA AI Accelerated application, indicating it is developed on the NVIDIA AI platform for performance and reliability.Running inference workloads in production requires fewer resources than training, which consumes large amounts of GPU compute and memory. Organizations sometimes run inference workloads on CPUs instead of GPUs, but this might mean higher latency. In many use cases for AI, the end user requires a real-time response: identification of a stop sign, facial recognition on a phone, or voice dictation, for example. CPU-based inference can be too slow for these applications.Using GPUs for inference workloads gives lower latency and higher accuracy, but this can be costly and wasteful when GPUs are not fully utilized. Run:ai's model-centric approach automatically adjusts to diverse workload requirements. With Run:ai, using a full GPU for a single lightweight workload is no longer required, saving considerable cost while maintaining low latency.Other new features of Run:ai Atlas for inference workloads include:Visibility and Monitoring - New inference-focused metrics and dashboards give insights into the health and performance of the AI models in production.Deploy Models on Fractional GPUs - Right-sizing models and deploying them on GPU fractions avoids resource waste and ensures performance requirements are met.Auto-Scaling - Allows organizations to automatically scale models up or down based on predefined thresholds using built-in and GPU-specific metrics. This ensures model Service Level Agreements (in terms of latency) are met.Scale-to-Zero - Automatically scales deployments to zero resources when possible, freeing up valuable resources which reduces cost and enables repurposing of resources for other workloads.\"With new advanced inference capabilities, Run:ai's Altas Platform now offers a solution for the entire AI lifecycle — from build to train to inference — all delivered in a single platform,\" said Ronen Dar, CTO and co-founder of Run:ai. \"Instead of using multiple different MLOps and orchestration tools, data scientists can benefit from one unified, powerful platform to manage all their AI infrastructure needs.\"\"The flexibility and portability of NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, available with NVIDIA AI Enterprise support, enables fast, simple scaling and deployment of trained AI models from any framework on any GPU- or CPU-based infrastructure,\" said Shankar Chandrasekaran, senior product manager at NVIDIA. \"Triton Inference Server's advanced performance and ease of use together with orchestration from Run:ai's Atlas Platform make it the ideal foundation for AI model deployment.\"View original content:  Run:AIThe above press release was provided courtesy of PRNewswire.

Fountain AI is a conversational artificial intelligence feature that accelerates the hiring funnel and helps hiring managers get candidates to their first day of work faster. Fountain AI enables recruiters to screen and qualify applicants more efficiently and automates processes that hiring managers typically perform manually. Recruiters don't always have the time to effectively manage talent pipelines and connect with candidates, which leads to disengaged candidates, application drop-offs, and interview no-shows. Through Fountain AI, enterprise organizations can streamline operations for recruiters and simplify the hiring funnel for candidates with mobile-first application features, automated data collection and sorting capabilities, and simple interview scheduling. Fountain AI also provides applicants with streamlined conversations that reduce mundane and repetitive application questions. By combining Fountain AI with the Fountain Labor ATS, organizations gain insights into hiring efficiencies to ensure they're keeping the right applicants moving through the pipeline, screening the right candidates, and efficiently staffing operations. \"Enterprise organizations are in tight competition for hourly talent and if you don't hire fast, you don't have staffed operations, which leads to a poor customer experience and negative business outcomes,\" says Sean Behr, CEO of Fountain. \"The addition of Fountain AI to our core offering creates an enhanced, user-friendly applicant experience for recruiters to move candidates through the funnel in minutes.\" Fountain AI simplifies the hiring process for both applicants and recruiters by guiding job candidates through an application with real-time responses, 24/7. With automated data collection and WhatsApp/SMS capabilities, applicants can now have richer digital, AI-powered conversations with recruiting teams by answering simple application questions and scheduling interviews without having to leave the chat. \"Engaging a high-volume hiring strategy that merges powerful AI technology with experienced talent acquisition professionals has proven to be the most successful way to win the race for top talent\" says Joe Bosch, Executive Advisory Board Member at SemperVirens Venture Capital. \"Fountain AI doesn't replace humans in the recruitment process, but becomes a critical tool in reducing the time spent on repetitive and mundane tasks, while simultaneously moving candidates through the process as quickly as possible.\" Fountain AI is available now for all existing Fountain customers in the United States and globally.

Semi-automated offside technology is to be used for the first time at the FIFA World Cup 2022. The referee and linesmen will now be assisted by a huge number of cameras, and advanced tracking technology that can detect if even the slightest slither of an attacking player is in front of the last defender and therefore OFFSIDE. As you can see from the short gif clip below, and the somewhat longer video at the bottom of this story, this new development of VAR (Video Assistant Referee) works in a very similar way to the existing tech, but now the footie AI detects offsides on its own, and alerts the video officials. Quite what the linesmen think about this, I don't know. They might as well just put their feet up, rather than running up and down with flags, looking like short-sighted idiots.(Image credit: FIFA)VAR hasn't been universally welcomed by soccer lovers, to put it mildly. However, much of the criticism has related to how and when the humans on the pitch choose to use it. With this development, a computer does the work for them. Could this be the beginning of the end for human linesmen, or even the man that fans lovingly call, 'the banker in the black'? We shall see…The VAR tech tracks multiple points of the body(Image credit: FIFA)FIFA says: 'The new technology uses 12 dedicated tracking cameras mounted underneath the roof of the stadium to track the ball and up to 29 data points of each individual player, 50 times per second, calculating their exact position on the pitch. The 29 collected data points include all limbs and extremities that are relevant for making offside calls.'As you no doubt know, the arms and hands are excluded from calculating whether a player is offside. It's not just the players being tracked, however. A sensor inside Adidas' official World Cup match ball also sends data to the video ops room 500 times per second, 'allowing a very precise detection of the kick point.'AI constantly analyses all these data points, and sends an alert to the officials in the VAR room when an offside is detected. Hopefully this alert is 'OFFSIDE DETECTED! OFFSIDE DETECTED! HALT PLAY!' in a Dalek voice.Ref! Offside! Get some new glasses!(Image credit: FIFA)The video guys then make sure the computer hasn't messed up. This part of the process is where there is potential for things to get controversial, I suspect. However, FIFA says it will happen 'within a few seconds', so there will hopefully be no more of that agonising and deeply annoying waiting around for offside decisions to be called. The video officials then notify the hapless buffoon on the pitch, via his earpiece. He then signals that he and his linesmen have yet again missed a blatant offside. After that, everyone gets to see the cool animation that the VAR system has generated, on the stadium's big screen and on the not-quite-so-big screen in your home or at the local sports bar.Though I say 'cool animation', this bit actually looks slightly grotesque(Image credit: FIFA)This system has already been trialled at events including the FIFA Arab Cup and FIFA Club World Cup, so hopefully things will run smoothly. The goal is to then fine-tune the system even further, 'to ensure that the new technology can be used in the world of football.' Although according to FIFA, it already has, so I'm not sure what that's about. What the VAR room officials will see(Image credit: FIFA)Amiable, bulging-eyed slaphead super-ref Pierluigi Collina is now chairman of the FIFA Referees Committee. He reached for his pocket and pulled out this statement: “VAR has already had a very positive impact on football and we can see that the number of major mistakes has already been dramatically reduced. We expect that semi-automated offside technology can take us a step further. We are aware that sometimes the process to check a possible offside takes too long, especially when the offside incident is very tight. This is where semi-automated offside technology comes in – to offer faster and more accurate decisions.”If Offside VAR is okay with Pierluigi, it's fine by us. GOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAL! Oh… Not a goal; VAR confirms it was offside.Further reading: a complete guide to the offside rule (opens in new tab) (from the FA) Duncan Bell Duncan has been writing about tech for almost 15 years and fitness ever since he became middle aged and realised he could no longer rely solely on his boyish good looks. He used to be on telly loads, but an unfortunate incident put a stop to that, so he now largely contents himself with telling people, \"I used to be on the TV, you know.\"  Pre-lockdown Duncan was widely regarded as the best-dressed man ever to work for T3 – admittedly not saying much. Post-lockdown he is looking forward to wearing clothes other than shorts and hoodies again very soon, assuming he can still fit into them. He currently writes about cycling, fitness tech that isn’t too heavy, and all things kitchen and home related.  Latest   Netflix's latest movie joins forces with Waze for new navigation voices New voices are coming to the navigation app for a limited time only By Alistair Charlton • Published 1 July 22 iPhone 14 Pro suddenly looks less appealing New rumor points to price hike By Robert Jones • Published 1 July 22 Useful links Features Amazon Prime Day (opens in new tab) PS5 restock tracker (opens in new tab) Best 5G phones (opens in new tab) Best VPN services (opens in new tab) Top Guides Best laptops (opens in new tab) Best TVs (opens in new tab) Best smartphones (opens in new tab) Best mattresses (opens in new tab) Best Deals Best phone deals (opens in new tab) Best mattress deals (opens in new tab) Best TV deals (opens in new tab) Discount codes (opens in new tab) T3 About Us (opens in new tab)Terms and conditions (opens in new tab)Privacy policy (opens in new tab)Cookies policy (opens in new tab)Accessibility Statement (opens in new tab)Careers (opens in new tab)T3 is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Advanced Model Serving Functionality to Help Organizations Simplify AI DeploymentPublished: Jul. 21, 2022 at 11:00 AM EDT|Updated: 1 hour agoInference-focused features, including integration with NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, make Run:ai Atlas the ideal AI infrastructure management platform for development, training and productionTEL AVIV, Israel, July 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Run:ai, the leader in compute orchestration for AI workloads, today announced new features of its Atlas Platform, including two-step model deployment — which makes it easier and faster to get machine learning models into production. The company also announced a new integration with NVIDIA Triton Inference Server. These capabilities are particularly focused on supporting organizations in deploying and using AI models for inference workloads on NVIDIA-accelerated computing, so they can provide accurate, real-time responses. The features cement Run:ai Atlas as a single unified platform where AI teams, from data scientists to MLOps engineers, can build, train and manage models in production from one simple interface.AI models can be challenging to deploy into production; despite the time and effort spent to build and train models, most never leave the lab. Configuring a model, connecting it to data and containers, and dedicating only the required amount of compute are major barriers to making AI work in production. Deploying a model usually requires manually editing and loading tedious YAML configuration files. Run:ai's new two-step deployment makes the process easy, enabling organizations to quickly switch between models, optimize for economical use of GPUs, and ensure that models run efficiently in production.Run:ai also announced full integration with NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, which allows organizations to deploy multiple models — or multiple instances of the same model — and run them in parallel within a single container. NVIDIA Triton Inference Server is included in the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, which is fully supported and optimized for AI development and deployment. Run:ai's orchestration works on top of NVIDIA Triton and provides auto-scaling, allocation and prioritization on a per-model basis — which right-sizes Triton automatically. Using Run:ai's Atlas with NVIDIA Triton leads to increased compute resource utilization while simplifying AI infrastructure. The Run.ai Atlas Platform is an NVIDIA AI Accelerated application, indicating it is developed on the NVIDIA AI platform for performance and reliability.Running inference workloads in production requires fewer resources than training, which consumes large amounts of GPU compute and memory. Organizations sometimes run inference workloads on CPUs instead of GPUs, but this might mean higher latency. In many use cases for AI, the end user requires a real-time response: identification of a stop sign, facial recognition on a phone, or voice dictation, for example. CPU-based inference can be too slow for these applications.Using GPUs for inference workloads gives lower latency and higher accuracy, but this can be costly and wasteful when GPUs are not fully utilized. Run:ai's model-centric approach automatically adjusts to diverse workload requirements. With Run:ai, using a full GPU for a single lightweight workload is no longer required, saving considerable cost while maintaining low latency.Other new features of Run:ai Atlas for inference workloads include:Visibility and Monitoring - New inference-focused metrics and dashboards give insights into the health and performance of the AI models in production.Deploy Models on Fractional GPUs - Right-sizing models and deploying them on GPU fractions avoids resource waste and ensures performance requirements are met.Auto-Scaling - Allows organizations to automatically scale models up or down based on predefined thresholds using built-in and GPU-specific metrics. This ensures model Service Level Agreements (in terms of latency) are met.Scale-to-Zero - Automatically scales deployments to zero resources when possible, freeing up valuable resources which reduces cost and enables repurposing of resources for other workloads.\"With new advanced inference capabilities, Run:ai's Altas Platform now offers a solution for the entire AI lifecycle — from build to train to inference — all delivered in a single platform,\" said Ronen Dar, CTO and co-founder of Run:ai. \"Instead of using multiple different MLOps and orchestration tools, data scientists can benefit from one unified, powerful platform to manage all their AI infrastructure needs.\"\"The flexibility and portability of NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, available with NVIDIA AI Enterprise support, enables fast, simple scaling and deployment of trained AI models from any framework on any GPU- or CPU-based infrastructure,\" said Shankar Chandrasekaran, senior product manager at NVIDIA. \"Triton Inference Server's advanced performance and ease of use together with orchestration from Run:ai's Atlas Platform make it the ideal foundation for AI model deployment.\"View original content:  Run:AIThe above press release was provided courtesy of PRNewswire.

electronic toll collection (ETC) newly set up at a roadside parking space on Yangzhuang road, Shijingshan district, Beijing. Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July 1, 2019. (People’s Daily Online/Li Wenming)  Thanks to the application of an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered roadside electronic toll collection (ETC) system, China’s capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.  As the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding 90 percent.  With the AI-empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.  “This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time,” recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.  “Since the summer of 2019, roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider,” Wang said.  The smart roadside ETC system “AIpark Sky Eye” adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing-based leading smart parking solution provider.  The company’s intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the country’s innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in 2018 by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).  Traditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles; each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot; and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.  Such problems don’t exist in smart machines. The “AIpark Sky Eye” system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.  Each set of cameras of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for 24 hours a day. The data collected by front-end cameras are processed using multi-dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.  The most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by high-mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes.  “For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians,” Xiang said.  Once the high-mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system.  Besides managing parking fee collection, high-mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.  So far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than 20 cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking industry. 【1】【2】【3】 Photos Naval fleet steams in East China Sea Newborn golden snub-nosed monkey makes debut In pics: birds across China Grain painting studio helps villagers to increase income Related Stories Exhibition highlighting art-science integration opens in BeijingChina’s AI industry poised to enter boom timesAlibaba outlines 10 technology trends for 2019China’s leading AI enterprise iFlytek to develop health information technologyCheetah Mobile wades into artificial intelligenceChina overtakes the US in investment in AI5 million artificial intelligence talents urgently needed in ChinaGraduate students give 'voice' to sign languageArtificial Intelligence in real livesMicrosoft embraces artificial intelligence About People's Daily Online |  Join Us |  Us  © 2021 People's Daily Online. .   \n",

The learn about noticed seven youngsters with gentle to average autism take domestic what’s referred to as a socially assistive robotic, named Kiwi, for a month. According to a commentary by way of the University of Southern California the place the crew is primarily based, the members from the Los Angeles house had been elderly between 3 and seven years previous, and performed space-themed video games with the robotic virtually day by day. As Kiwi was once fitted with machine-learning era, it was once in a position to offer distinctive comments and directions to the kids in accordance with their talents. For example, if the kid were given a query incorrect Kiwi would give activates to assist them resolve it, and tweak the trouble ranges to problem the kid correctly. The authors of the paper revealed within the magazine Science Robotics discovered all the youngsters noticed their reasoning talents support. Some 92 % had higher social talents after enjoying with Kiwi for a month, in keeping with the commentary. Cameras hooked as much as Kiwi enabled the crew to additionally observe how engaged the children had been with the robotic, in accordance with the place their eyes had been taking a look, the placement in their heads, their speech and how smartly they carried out on a role. The crew discovered engagement ranged from 48 to 84 % on reasonable a few of the members, and Kiwi was once in a position to stumble on a disengaged kid with 90 % accuracy. That was once in spite of possible distractions akin to domestic home equipment, in addition to buddies and circle of relatives. The crew discovered members had been maximum engaged in an instant after the robotic had spoken, however this went down if the space lasted longer than a minute. Lead writer Shomik Jain, advised Newsweek the kids changed into much less engaged because the month went on.  “Examples of child behavior during these disengaged periods included playing with toys, interacting with siblings, and even abruptly leaving the intervention setting.” “This served as a motivation for our work, which created models that could be used for real-time recognition and response to disengagement in order to re-engage the child to continue with the educational and/or therapeutic activity,” he stated. From left to proper, lead writer Shomik Jain with co-authors Kartik Mahajan and Zhonghao Shi, all scholars in Professor Maja Matarić’s interplay lab, with Kiwi the socially assistive robotic. Haotian mai Around one in 59 youngsters within the U.S. have autism, in keeping with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

While therapists may give individualized products and services that assist to show such youngsters social talents, now not everybody can have the funds for this, the crew stated. As such, they sought after to discover the potential for plugging the space with robots. Co-author Maja Matarić Maja J Matarić, outstanding professor of pc science, neuroscience, and pediatrics on the University of Southern California advised Newsweek: “We and other researchers have been actively exploring SAR [socially assistive robotics] for children with ASD, because SAR has great potential in supporting the learning of children with ASD. Since we were one of the very few labs that has worked in SAR from its inception, we used our experience over the past 15 years to develop the robot that would meet the needs and interests of children with ASD while being safe and non-threatening.” Jain stated: “Currently, robots are restricted of their skill to autonomously acknowledge and reply to human conduct, particularly in ordinary customers and real-world settings akin to houses and colleges. Engaging customers is a key HRI [human-robot interaction] capacity in the past unexplored within the context of long-term, in-home SAR interventions for youngsters with ASD. “Therefore this learn about is the primary to use mechanical device studying modeling to long-term in-home knowledge with youngsters with ASD. “ Asked why the kids’s engagement and studying stepped forward after interacting with the robotic, Matarić stated: “The objective of a socially assistive robotic, usually, is to serve within the function of a motivating and supportive spouse. In the particular context of this learn about, the robotic served to inspire the kids to do the maths workouts, and to make stronger them as they had been succeeding or failing throughout the ones workouts.” However, youngsters with autism do not want robots to harvest the advantages noticed within the learn about, Matarić stated. “The maximum healing results come from being concerned human interactions,” Matarić explained. “Parents, siblings, caregivers and buddies can successfully inspire and make stronger studying and remedy of kids with ASD by way of paying cautious consideration to what youngsters to find rewarding and encouraging, and specializing in the ones interactions, shaping towards the kid’s particular wishes.” Share This To World:TweetWhatsApp  ← Vogue fashion, 21, whose mysterious half-naked 4am balcony fall shattered bones all over her body finally takes first step Exclusive: Levi’s introduces paid family leave for workers → You May Also Like   Last Minute New Orleans Hotel and Flight Package Offers  February 21, 2020February 21, 2020 admin 0   Accused Marie Yovanovitch ‘Stalker’ Robert Hyde Now Supplying Documents to Congress  February 12, 2020February 12, 2020 admin 0   Who Won the Tenth Democratic Debate in South Carolina?

The world entered a new era of accelerated transformation in the last eighteen months that will continue to evolve and press forward for years to come. Most businesses are playing catch-up trying to make sense of a new timeline where the ten years that had been set aside for careful planning and implementation of what was coming up next no longer exists. The next is happening now and, regardless of your industry or seniority, the status quo has shifted and you better face it. Back in 2019, I was invited to attend a pompous meeting in London at the Brazilian Embassy along with selected leading names from the oil and energy industry, to get an update on what was going to happen in the following decade. I could soon spot all the buzzwords coming up on PowerPoint slides from the different companies presenting: decommissioning, decarbonisation, zero emissions, transition to green energy. Throughout the morning and most of the afternoon, we heard that most of these changes would kick in between 2030-35. And I recall a Shell executive pointing out that the business had explicitly concluded that the current income streams were needed to provide the capital required for the transition to take place in due course.Whomever you talk to in the energy industry in 2021 would tell you to forget about that timeline. Change has come and the transition is happening much faster than anticipated, with big businesses scrambling to find the capital to fund all that is required. I could go on all day talking about how the pandemic and the impact it had on market demand and consumer behaviour messed up the timeline of transport, automotive, defence, manufacturing and so on. For instance, carrier planes that were due to be retired in 2017 are now required to remain in service at least until 2029. Projects in wind power involving upgrades of wind farms have been scrapped and new installations have drawn huge competition from up and coming brands with operators tending to favour smaller turbines – for being efficient and cheaper to run – and choosing to buy from multiple suppliers instead of just one company. Machine learning (ML), AI and Industry 4.0 knock at the door. Still, the biggest change yet to be fully appreciated by business leaders is how electronics effectively became the brain of every industrial asset and all infrastructure equipment in operation in recent years, and therefore what is required to deal with breakdowns and obsolescence. For instance, I lost count of the many rail connections that I have working in operations and maintenance who struggle with their CME – chief mechanical engineer – who, like the role suggests, is usually a mechanically-biased individual who may have a less than ideal approach when it comes to the handling of electronic failures. And you guessed right: less ideal means neither green nor cheap solutions, as illustrated in this video:  Many decision-makers only realise the problem at hand and regret not following the tag  on LinkedIn in times like this, resulting in comments like, \"We did not anticipate that the equipment would become obsolete so quickly!\" or, \"Spare circuit boards started to take weeks then months to arrive. Then we were told that they would no longer be supplied. We were quoted seven-figure prices to upgrade our assembly line.\"By deferring the responsibility to the original equipment supplier and other third parties, you are bound to be caught off guard soon or later. And the risk exposure from insisting on this strategy is about to get exponentially higher; there is a widespread component shortage increasing lead times, and technology providers are dropping support for many products in order to remain viable.Last month, a wind turbine multinational in the US had to ship a bunch of expensive controller cards used in inverters and speed governing systems to its workshop in Brazil for repair as new replacement cards are not due back in stock for another six months. Good job that the local team had an electronic diagnostic equipment BoardMaster from ABI in the shop, ready to help the technicians locate the fault and repair the cards, which happened in record time.Poor decision-making when it comes to setting maintenance and repair strategies are often linked to ‘fake news’ and myths such as:• A repaired electronic card (PCB/PCBA) will never be as good as a new one.• The manufacturer told us that special software was required to troubleshoot the card.• Troubleshooting down to the component level is impossible or would take too long.• Dedicated test and repair equipment is prohibitively expensive.The mentality here needs to change, and fast. The longer you take to embrace the new strategies for in-house fault analysis, maintenance, and obsolescence planning of your key electronic circuits and assets, the more expensive it will get to keep them going. Hundreds of leading organisations have found in recent years that the belief in these myths was hindering their results and compromising the operation – from GE Renewable to Collins Aerospace, where the latter reduced troubleshooting times on avionics circuit cards from 50 hours to 10 minutes. Then there is Lego in Mexico, where controller cards from 600+ plastic moulding machines worth tens of thousands of dollars each have been mapped and are now repaired in-house. In the US, an army engineer saved a mobile shelter unit worth 10 million dollars from being decommissioned by repairing its HVAC circuit board that was deemed ‘irreparable’ by the OEM. In the rail arena, companies like Alstom, CAF, Bombardier and operators like Irish Rail, SFMTA, TCDD and so many others have discovered the benefits of investing in the right tool and skill development programme to shield the business against parts shortages and accelerated obsolescence. Some of their stories, and the technology that is driving several top-shelf global sustainability projects, were the subject of a YouTube series called ABI Labs. The series gives an in-depth review of the key tests and techniques available in the British-made BoardMaster hardware and software platform from ABI Electronics to handle predictive as well as corrective maintenance of critical electronics without wasting time or money.

Artificial Intelligence Now Powers the Majority of Smartphones BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Strategy Analytics in a newly published report, Smartphones: Global Artificial Intelligence Technologies Forecast to 2025, finds that on-device Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being rapidly implemented by smartphone vendors. AI is used in various functions inside smartphones such as intelligent power optimization, imaging, virtual assistants, and to enhance device performance. The report highlights the fact that AI has become the most important technology in modern smartphones. The push to add on-device AI computational power to enable Edge AI computing is a priority for smartphone and chipset vendors.  “Strategy Analytics estimates that 71% of all smartphones sold worldwide in 2021 will have on-device AI,” says Associate Director Ville-Petteri Ukonaho. “Advantages of on-device AI computing include lower latency, better data privacy and overall lower power consumption.” An Artificial Intelligence (AI) smartphone is one that uses an AI core / processor designed to run machine learning and deep learning tasks. AI smartphones run AI tasks locally on the device with the help of dedicated AI cores and AI co-processors with little or no data transmitted to the cloud. Examples of AI smartphones include Apple’s iPhone 12 Pro Max and Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. “Artificial Intelligence has become a key technology in higher-end smartphones,” says Ken Hyers, Director at Strategy Analytics. “A smartphone equipped with on-device AI can significantly improve important tasks like helping users take better pictures, deliver longer battery life through efficient power management, improve the speed of response by digital assistants, and power Augmented Reality, among other tasks. This makes smartphones more useful tools for users.” “Modern smartphones give consumers access to their own personal AI powered super-computer,” says Ville-Petteri Ukonaho. “With the help of on-device Artificial Intelligence, virtual assistants like Siri and Google’s Assistant have become more intelligent and aware of their environment.” Strategy Analytics new report estimates that in 2021 over 80% of smartphones globally will have virtual assistants and the share will grow to 97% by 2025. “With the enhanced AI capabilities on-device, virtual assistants have become more intelligent and aware of their environment,” comments Ken Hyers. Strategy Analytics’ report finds that Google’s Assistant is the top virtual assistant in 2021 with over 60% share followed by Apple’s Siri. On-device AI is powered by physical silicon cores such as Apple’s Neural Engine or distributed software frameworks such as Qualcomm Neural Processing Engine (NPE) that use algorithms to offload AI computation to several processors (CPU, GPU and DSP). “Physical AI cores have greater capability to handle complex AI computations, thus those are being introduced by all major chip vendors such as Mediatek, Samsung and HiSilicon,” says Ville-Petteri Ukonaho. “Camera AI has become one of the key selling points of imaging focused smartphones,” says Ken Hyers and continues, “Artificial Intelligence features such as object recognition or motion detection are becoming growingly important in premium smartphones.” In the report Strategy Analytics concludes that over 30% of smartphones already have AI enhanced camera functionalities. Strategy Analytics finds in its latest report that technologies such as 5G will greatly benefit from the new capabilities improved by AI and vice versa. With the help of 5G and AI, smartphones have become integral part of a large device ecosystem enabling them to share data and communicate with each other.

       "4     Olympus to Support Endoscopic AI Diagnosis Education for Doctors in India and to Launch AI Diagnostic Support Application | | IT Business Net   Skip to content IT Business Net News for IT Professionals Primary Menu IT Business Net About IT Business Net  for:   Home2020OctoberOlympus to Support Endoscopic AI Diagnosis Education for Doctors in India and to Launch AI Diagnostic Support Application                                     News                                 Olympus to Support Endoscopic AI Diagnosis Education for Doctors in India and to Launch AI Diagnostic Support Application   TOKYO, Oct 20, 2020 – (ACN Newswire) –  Olympus Corporation took part in a ground-breaking project as a business promoter, in cooperation with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), entitled, “Survey Study for International Expansion of AI Diagnosis Support System Using Ultra-High Magnifying Endoscopes in India.” The project aims to develop advanced endoscopy diagnostics in India, where there are relatively few endoscopists. In collaboration with CYBERNET SYSTEMS CO,. LTD., Olympus has established an AI diagnostic support system at a major medical institution, the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology (AIG) based in Hyderabad, India. Specialist lecturers and physicians from Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital provided expert guidance to AIG doctors. In addition to training AIG doctors in techniques for detecting diseases and differential diagnosis by colonoscope, they also trained the doctors on how to instruct the next generation of endoscopists. The project started on October 12. At the kick-off meeting, Satoshi Hemmi, Deputy Director-General of the Information and Communications Bureau, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications commented, “We hope to contribute to the spread of AI endoscopy systems and the development of medical care in India through training future leaders in AI endoscopy systems in India. We also hope that the cooperation between India and Japan in the field of healthcare ICT will continue to develop.” In addition to the ultra-magnifying scope Endocyto(*1) released last year, Olympus will release endoscopic diagnostic support software equipped with AI in India from December. The endoscopic diagnostic support software EndoBRAIN(*2) and EndoBRAIN-EYE(*3) will be utilized for physician training in India. Olympus intends to assist in the development of physicians and promote the use of endoscopic diagnostics. (*1) An endoscope that enables observation at the cellular level in real time with up to 520 times optical magnification.(*2) AI real-time in-vivo analysis of colon lesions taken with ultra-high magnifying endoscopes, numerically indicating the possibility of neoplastic and non-neoplastic polyps to assist physicians in the differentiation and detection of polyps through figures.(*3) AI endoscopic diagnostic imaging support software that assists physicians in diagnosing lesions by alerting if a polyp or other lesion is detected using regular colonoscope images.  Background of Olympus’ Participation In India, the rate of cancer morbidity is expected to increase as the economy grows. On the other hand, there is a severe shortage of doctors who can conduct precision diagnostics with endoscopes, which are essential for early detection and treatment of cancer. Olympus participated in this project to support trained AIG specialists to train doctors in India and neighboring countries and to contribute to the popularization and development of endoscope diagnostics using the latest AI technology. Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications Project – Purpose:The MIC aims to realize the sustainable development goal and SDG pledges to ensure “no one will be left behind.” To this end, the MIC aims to realize a model that contributes to SDG through digitization and to disseminate and promote an SDG + ICT model domestically and overseas between both public and private sectors. This project aims to contribute to the introduction and dissemination of Japan’s endoscopic AI diagnostic support system to India and neighboring countries in response to the social issue of increasing cancer prevalence in India. – Projects:1) Survey on the Current Status of Policies in the Medical Health Sector in India and the Current Status of the Introduction of Medical ICT in India:Collecting information from major medical institutions and external research institutions and investigating the spread of medical systems, including endoscopic systems. 2) Verification through proof-of-concept tests in India:Physicians from the Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital will train AIG physicians, from the detection of disease utilizing a colonoscope to discriminatory diagnosis, and train them as lecturers to train instructors. MIC provided equipment and training courses. For questions or additional information, please contact:Yuka Horimoto+81-90-2490-1071[email protected]   2020 ACN Newswire. .

intelligence improves parking efficiency in Chinese cities By LiuShiyao Peoples Daily 09:16, March 18, 2021 Photo taken on July 1, 2019, shows a sign for electronic toll collection ETC newly set up at a roadside parking space on Yangzhuang road, Shijingshan district, Beijing. Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July 1, 2019. Peoples Daily OnlineLi WenmingThanks to the application of an artificial intelligence AIempowered roadside electronic toll collection ETC system, Chinas capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.As the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding 90 percent.With the AIempowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time, recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.Since the summer of 2019, roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider, Wang said.The smart roadside ETC system AIpark Sky Eye adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijingbased leading smart parking solution provider.The companys intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the countrys innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in 2018 by Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology MIIT.Traditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.Such problems dont exist in smart machines. The AIpark Sky Eye system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.Each set of cameras of the AIpark Sky Eye system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for 24 hours a day. The data collected by frontend cameras are processed using multidimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.The most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by highmounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes.For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians, Xiang said.Once the highmounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the AIpark Sky Eye system.Besides managing parking fee collection, highmounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.So far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than 20 cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking industry. 123 Photos Naval fleet steams in East China Sea Newborn golden snubnosed monkey makes debut In pics: birds across China Grain painting studio helps villagers to increase income Related Stories Exhibition highlighting artscience integration opens in BeijingChinas AI industry poised to enter boom timesAlibaba outlines 10 technology trends for 2019Chinas leading AI enterprise iFlytek to develop health information technologyCheetah Mobile wades into artificial intelligenceChina overtakes the US in investment in AI5 million artificial intelligence talents urgently needed in ChinaGraduate students give voice to sign languageArtificial Intelligence in real livesMicrosoft embraces artificial intelligence About Peoples Daily OnlineJoin UsUs2021 Peoples Daily Online. .\n",

The learn about noticed seven youngsters with gentle to average autism take domestic whats referred to as a socially assistive robotic, named Kiwi, for a month. According to a commentary by way of the University of Southern California the place the crew is primarily based, the members from the Los Angeles house had been elderly between 3 and seven years previous, and performed spacethemed video games with the robotic virtually day by day. As Kiwi was once fitted with machinelearning era, it was once in a position to offer distinctive comments and directions to the kids in accordance with their talents. For example, if the kid were given a query incorrect Kiwi would give activates to assist them resolve it, and tweak the trouble ranges to problem the kid correctly. The authors of the paper revealed within the magazine Science Robotics discovered all the youngsters noticed their reasoning talents support. Some 92had higher social talents after enjoying with Kiwi for a month, in keeping with the commentary. Cameras hooked as much as Kiwi enabled the crew to additionally observe how engaged the children had been with the robotic, in accordance with the place their eyes had been taking a look, the placement in their heads, their speech and how smartly they carried out on a role. The crew discovered engagement ranged from 48 to 84on reasonable a few of the members, and Kiwi was once in a position to stumble on a disengaged kid with 90accuracy. That was once in spite of possible distractions akin to domestic home equipment, in addition to buddies and circle of relatives. The crew discovered members had been maximum engaged in an instant after the robotic had spoken, however this went down if the space lasted longer than a minute. Lead writer Shomik Jain, advised Newsweek the kids changed into much less engaged because the month went on.Examples of child behavior during these disengaged periods included playing with toys, interacting with siblings, and even abruptly leaving the intervention setting. This served as a motivation for our work, which created models that could be used for realtime recognition and response to disengagement in order to reengage the child to continue with the educational andor therapeutic activity, he stated. From left to proper, lead writer Shomik Jain with coauthors Kartik Mahajan and Zhonghao Shi, all scholars in Professor Maja Mataris interplay lab, with Kiwi the socially assistive robotic. Haotian mai Around one in 59 youngsters within the U.S. have autism, in keeping with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People with the situation, often referred to as autism spectrum dysfunction ASD, can to find it difficult to keep in touch and engage in the similar manner as neurotypical other folks. While therapists may give individualized products and services that assist to show such youngsters social talents, now not everybody can have the funds for this, the crew stated. As such, they sought after to discover the potential for plugging the space with robots. Coauthor Maja Matari Maja J Matari, outstanding professor of pc science, neuroscience, and pediatrics on the University of Southern California advised Newsweek: We and other researchers have been actively exploring SAR socially assistive robotics for children with ASD, because SAR has great potential in supporting the learning of children with ASD. Since we were one of the very few labs that has worked in SAR from its inception, we used our experience over the past 15 years to develop the robot that would meet the needs and interests of children with ASD while being safe and nonthreatening. Jain stated: Currently, robots are restricted of their skill to autonomously acknowledge and reply to human conduct, particularly in ordinary customers and realworld settings akin to houses and colleges. Engaging customers is a key HRI humanrobot interaction capacity in the past unexplored within the context of longterm, inhome SAR interventions for youngsters with ASD. Therefore this learn about is the primary to use mechanical device studying modeling to longterm inhome knowledge with youngsters with ASD.Asked why the kidss engagement and studying stepped forward after interacting with the robotic, Matari stated: The objective of a socially assistive robotic, usually, is to serve within the function of a motivating and supportive spouse. In the particular context of this learn about, the robotic served to inspire the kids to do the maths workouts, and to make stronger them as they had been succeeding or failing throughout the ones workouts. However, youngsters with autism do not want robots to harvest the advantages noticed within the learn about, Matari stated. The maximum healing results come from being concerned human interactions, Matari explained.

The world entered a new era of accelerated transformation in the last eighteen months that will continue to evolve and press forward for years to come. Most businesses are playing catchup trying to make sense of a new timeline where the ten years that had been set aside for careful planning and implementation of what was coming up next no longer exists. The next is happening now and, regardless of your industry or seniority, the status quo has shifted and you better face it. Back in 2019, I was invited to attend a pompous meeting in London at the Brazilian Embassy along with selected leading names from the oil and energy industry, to get an update on what was going to happen in the following decade. I could soon spot all the buzzwords coming up on PowerPoint slides from the different companies presenting: decommissioning, decarbonisation, zero emissions, transition to green energy. Throughout the morning and most of the afternoon, we heard that most of these changes would kick in between 203035. And I recall a Shell executive pointing out that the business had explicitly concluded that the current income streams were needed to provide the capital required for the transition to take place in due course.Whomever you talk to in the energy industry in 2021 would tell you to forget about that timeline. Change has come and the transition is happening much faster than anticipated, with big businesses scrambling to find the capital to fund all that is required. I could go on all day talking about how the pandemic and the impact it had on market demand and consumer behaviour messed up the timeline of transport, automotive, defence, manufacturing and so on. For instance, carrier planes that were due to be retired in 2017 are now required to remain in service at least until 2029. Projects in wind power involving upgrades of wind farms have been scrapped and new installations have drawn huge competition from up and coming brands with operators tending to favour smaller turbinesfor being efficient and cheaper to runand choosing to buy from multiple suppliers instead of just one company. Machine learning ML, AI and Industry 4.0 knock at the door. Still, the biggest change yet to be fully appreciated by business leaders is how electronics effectively became the brain of every industrial asset and all infrastructure equipment in operation in recent years, and therefore what is required to deal with breakdowns and obsolescence. For instance, I lost count of the many rail connections that I have working in operations and maintenance who struggle with their CMEchief mechanical engineerwho, like the role suggests, is usually a mechanicallybiased individual who may have a less than ideal approach when it comes to the handling of electronic failures. And you guessed right: less ideal means neither green nor cheap solutions, as illustrated in this video:Many decisionmakers only realise the problem at hand and regret not following the tagon LinkedIn in times like this, resulting in comments like, We did not anticipate that the equipment would become obsolete so quickly or, Spare circuit boards started to take weeks then months to arrive. Then we were told that they would no longer be supplied. We were quoted sevenfigure prices to upgrade our assembly line.By deferring the responsibility to the original equipment supplier and other third parties, you are bound to be caught off guard soon or later. And the risk exposure from insisting on this strategy is about to get exponentially higher there is a widespread component shortage increasing lead times, and technology providers are dropping support for many products in order to remain viable.Last month, a wind turbine multinational in the US had to ship a bunch of expensive controller cards used in inverters and speed governing systems to its workshop in Brazil for repair as new replacement cards are not due back in stock for another six months. Good job that the local team had an electronic diagnostic equipment BoardMaster from ABI in the shop, ready to help the technicians locate the fault and repair the cards, which happened in record time.Poor decisionmaking when it comes to setting maintenance and repair strategies are often linked to fake news and myths such as: A repaired electronic card PCBPCBA will never be as good as a new one. The manufacturer told us that special software was required to troubleshoot the card. Troubleshooting down to the component level is impossible or would take too long. Dedicated test and repair equipment is prohibitively expensive.The mentality here needs to change, and fast. The longer you take to embrace the new strategies for inhouse fault analysis, maintenance, and obsolescence planning of your key electronic circuits and assets, the more expensive it will get to keep them going. Hundreds of leading organisations have found in recent years that the belief in these myths was hindering their results and compromising the operationfrom GE Renewable to Collins Aerospace, where the latter reduced troubleshooting times on avionics circuit cards from 50 hours to 10 minutes. Then there is Lego in Mexico, where controller cards from 600 plastic moulding machines worth tens of thousands of dollars each have been mapped and are now repaired inhouse. In the US, an army engineer saved a mobile shelter unit worth 10 million dollars from being decommissioned by repairing its HVAC circuit board that was deemed irreparable by the OEM. In the rail arena, companies like Alstom, CAF, Bombardier and operators like Irish Rail, SFMTA, TCDD and so many others have discovered the benefits of investing in the right tool and skill development programme to shield the business against parts shortages and accelerated obsolescence. Some of their stories, and the technology that is driving several topshelf global sustainability projects, were the subject of a YouTube series called ABI Labs.

Strategy Analytics new report estimates that in 2021 over 80 of smartphones globally will have virtual assistants and the share will grow to 97 by 2025. With the enhanced AI capabilities ondevice, virtual assistants have become more intelligent and aware of their environment, comments Ken Hyers. Strategy Analytics report finds that Googles Assistant is the top virtual assistant in 2021 with over 60 share followed by Apples Siri. Ondevice AI is powered by physical silicon cores such as Apples Neural Engine or distributed software frameworks such as Qualcomm Neural Processing Engine NPE that use algorithms to offload AI computation to several processors CPU, GPU and DSP. Physical AI cores have greater capability to handle complex AI computations, thus those are being introduced by all major chip vendors such as Mediatek, Samsung and HiSilicon, says VillePetteri Ukonaho. Camera AI has become one of the key selling points of imaging focused smartphones, says Ken Hyers and continues, Artificial Intelligence features such as object recognition or motion detection are becoming growingly important in premium smartphones. In the report Strategy Analytics concludes that over 30 of smartphones already have AI enhanced camera functionalities. Strategy Analytics finds in its latest report that technologies such as 5G will greatly benefit from the new capabilities improved by AI and vice versa. With the help of 5G and AI, smartphones have become integral part of a large device ecosystem enabling them to share data and communicate with each other.

Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July 1, 2019. Peoples Daily OnlineLi WenmingThanks to the application of an artificial intelligence AIempowered roadside electronic toll collection ETC system, Chinas capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.As the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding 90 percent.With the AIempowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time, recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.Since the summer of 2019, roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider, Wang said.The smart roadside ETC system AIpark Sky Eye adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijingbased leading smart parking solution provider.The companys intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the countrys innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in 2018 by Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology MIIT.Traditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.Such problems dont exist in smart machines. The AIpark Sky Eye system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.Each set of cameras of the AIpark Sky Eye system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for 24 hours a day. The data collected by frontend cameras are processed using multidimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.The most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by highmounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes.For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians, Xiang said.Once the highmounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the AIpark Sky Eye system.Besides managing parking fee collection, highmounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.So far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than 20 cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking industry. 123 Photos Naval fleet steams in East China Sea Newborn golden snubnosed monkey makes debut In pics: birds across China Grain painting studio helps villagers to increase income Related Stories Exhibition highlighting artscience integration opens in BeijingChinas AI industry poised to enter boom timesAlibaba outlines 10 technology trends for 2019Chinas leading AI enterprise iFlytek to develop health information technologyCheetah Mobile wades into artificial intelligenceChina overtakes the US in investment in AI5 million artificial intelligence talents urgently needed in ChinaGraduate students give voice to sign languageArtificial Intelligence in real livesMicrosoft embraces artificial intelligence About Peoples Daily OnlineJoin UsUs2021 Peoples Daily Online. .</td>\n",

The learn about noticed seven youngsters with gentle to average autism take domestic whats referred to as a socially assistive robotic, named Kiwi, for a month. According to a commentary by way of the University of Southern California the place the crew is primarily based, the members from the Los Angeles house had been elderly between 3 and seven years previous, and performed spacethemed video games with the robotic virtually day by day. As Kiwi was once fitted with machinelearning era, it was once in a position to offer distinctive comments and directions to the kids in accordance with their talents. For example, if the kid were given a query incorrect Kiwi would give activates to assist them resolve it, and tweak the trouble ranges to problem the kid correctly. The authors of the paper revealed within the magazine Science Robotics discovered all the youngsters noticed their reasoning talents support. Some 92had higher social talents after enjoying with Kiwi for a month, in keeping with the commentary. Cameras hooked as much as Kiwi enabled the crew to additionally observe how engaged the children had been with the robotic, in accordance with the place their eyes had been taking a look, the placement in their heads, their speech and how smartly they carried out on a role. The crew discovered engagement ranged from 48 to 84on reasonable a few of the members, and Kiwi was once in a position to stumble on a disengaged kid with 90accuracy. That was once in spite of possible distractions akin to domestic home equipment, in addition to buddies and circle of relatives. The crew discovered members had been maximum engaged in an instant after the robotic had spoken, however this went down if the space lasted longer than a minute. Lead writer Shomik Jain, advised Newsweek the kids changed into much less engaged because the month went on.Examples of child behavior during these disengaged periods included playing with toys, interacting with siblings, and even abruptly leaving the intervention setting. This served as a motivation for our work, which created models that could be used for realtime recognition and response to disengagement in order to reengage the child to continue with the educational andor therapeutic activity, he stated. From left to proper, lead writer Shomik Jain with coauthors Kartik Mahajan and Zhonghao Shi, all scholars in Professor Maja Mataris interplay lab, with Kiwi the socially assistive robotic. Haotian mai Around one in 59 youngsters within the U.S. have autism, in keeping with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People with the situation, often referred to as autism spectrum dysfunction ASD, can to find it difficult to keep in touch and engage in the similar manner as neurotypical other folks. While therapists may give individualized products and services that assist to show such youngsters social talents, now not everybody can have the funds for this, the crew stated. As such, they sought after to discover the potential for plugging the space with robots. Coauthor Maja Matari Maja J Matari, outstanding professor of pc science, neuroscience, and pediatrics on the University of Southern California advised Newsweek: We and other researchers have been actively exploring SAR socially assistive robotics for children with ASD, because SAR has great potential in supporting the learning of children with ASD. Since we were one of the very few labs that has worked in SAR from its inception, we used our experience over the past 15 years to develop the robot that would meet the needs and interests of children with ASD while being safe and nonthreatening. Jain stated: Currently, robots are restricted of their skill to autonomously acknowledge and reply to human conduct, particularly in ordinary customers and realworld settings akin to houses and colleges. Engaging customers is a key HRI humanrobot interaction capacity in the past unexplored within the context of longterm, inhome SAR interventions for youngsters with ASD. Therefore this learn about is the primary to use mechanical device studying modeling to longterm inhome knowledge with youngsters with ASD.Asked why the kidss engagement and studying stepped forward after interacting with the robotic, Matari stated: The objective of a socially assistive robotic, usually, is to serve within the function of a motivating and supportive spouse. In the particular context of this learn about, the robotic served to inspire the kids to do the maths workouts, and to make stronger them as they had been succeeding or failing throughout the ones workouts. However, youngsters with autism do not want robots to harvest the advantages noticed within the learn about, Matari stated. The maximum healing results come from being concerned human interactions, Matari explained. Parents, siblings, caregivers and buddies can successfully inspire and make stronger studying and remedy of kids with ASD by way of paying cautious consideration to what youngsters to find rewarding and encouraging, and specializing in the ones interactions, shaping towards the kids particular wishes.

The world entered a new era of accelerated transformation in the last eighteen months that will continue to evolve and press forward for years to come. Most businesses are playing catchup trying to make sense of a new timeline where the ten years that had been set aside for careful planning and implementation of what was coming up next no longer exists. The next is happening now and, regardless of your industry or seniority, the status quo has shifted and you better face it. Back in 2019, I was invited to attend a pompous meeting in London at the Brazilian Embassy along with selected leading names from the oil and energy industry, to get an update on what was going to happen in the following decade. I could soon spot all the buzzwords coming up on PowerPoint slides from the different companies presenting: decommissioning, decarbonisation, zero emissions, transition to green energy. Throughout the morning and most of the afternoon, we heard that most of these changes would kick in between 203035. And I recall a Shell executive pointing out that the business had explicitly concluded that the current income streams were needed to provide the capital required for the transition to take place in due course.Whomever you talk to in the energy industry in 2021 would tell you to forget about that timeline. Change has come and the transition is happening much faster than anticipated, with big businesses scrambling to find the capital to fund all that is required. I could go on all day talking about how the pandemic and the impact it had on market demand and consumer behaviour messed up the timeline of transport, automotive, defence, manufacturing and so on. For instance, carrier planes that were due to be retired in 2017 are now required to remain in service at least until 2029. Projects in wind power involving upgrades of wind farms have been scrapped and new installations have drawn huge competition from up and coming brands with operators tending to favour smaller turbinesfor being efficient and cheaper to runand choosing to buy from multiple suppliers instead of just one company. Machine learning ML, AI and Industry 4.0 knock at the door. Still, the biggest change yet to be fully appreciated by business leaders is how electronics effectively became the brain of every industrial asset and all infrastructure equipment in operation in recent years, and therefore what is required to deal with breakdowns and obsolescence. For instance, I lost count of the many rail connections that I have working in operations and maintenance who struggle with their CMEchief mechanical engineerwho, like the role suggests, is usually a mechanicallybiased individual who may have a less than ideal approach when it comes to the handling of electronic failures. And you guessed right: less ideal means neither green nor cheap solutions, as illustrated in this video:Many decisionmakers only realise the problem at hand and regret not following the tagon LinkedIn in times like this, resulting in comments like, We did not anticipate that the equipment would become obsolete so quickly or, Spare circuit boards started to take weeks then months to arrive. Then we were told that they would no longer be supplied. We were quoted sevenfigure prices to upgrade our assembly line.By deferring the responsibility to the original equipment supplier and other third parties, you are bound to be caught off guard soon or later. And the risk exposure from insisting on this strategy is about to get exponentially higher there is a widespread component shortage increasing lead times, and technology providers are dropping support for many products in order to remain viable.Last month, a wind turbine multinational in the US had to ship a bunch of expensive controller cards used in inverters and speed governing systems to its workshop in Brazil for repair as new replacement cards are not due back in stock for another six months. Good job that the local team had an electronic diagnostic equipment BoardMaster from ABI in the shop, ready to help the technicians locate the fault and repair the cards, which happened in record time.Poor decisionmaking when it comes to setting maintenance and repair strategies are often linked to fake news and myths such as: A repaired electronic card PCBPCBA will never be as good as a new one. The manufacturer told us that special software was required to troubleshoot the card. Troubleshooting down to the component level is impossible or would take too long. Dedicated test and repair equipment is prohibitively expensive.The mentality here needs to change, and fast. The longer you take to embrace the new strategies for inhouse fault analysis, maintenance, and obsolescence planning of your key electronic circuits and assets, the more expensive it will get to keep them going. Hundreds of leading organisations have found in recent years that the belief in these myths was hindering their results and compromising the operationfrom GE Renewable to Collins Aerospace, where the latter reduced troubleshooting times on avionics circuit cards from 50 hours to 10 minutes. Then there is Lego in Mexico, where controller cards from 600 plastic moulding machines worth tens of thousands of dollars each have been mapped and are now repaired inhouse. In the US, an army engineer saved a mobile shelter unit worth 10 million dollars from being decommissioned by repairing its HVAC circuit board that was deemed irreparable by the OEM. In the rail arena, companies like Alstom, CAF, Bombardier and operators like Irish Rail, SFMTA, TCDD and so many others have discovered the benefits of investing in the right tool and skill development programme to shield the business against parts shortages and accelerated obsolescence. Some of their stories, and the technology that is driving several topshelf global sustainability projects, were the subject of a YouTube series called ABI Labs. The series gives an indepth review of the key tests and techniques available in the Britishmade BoardMaster hardware and software platform from ABI Electronics to handle predictive as well as corrective maintenance of critical electronics without wasting time or money.

The project aims to develop advanced endoscopy diagnostics in India, where there are relatively few endoscopists. In collaboration with CYBERNET SYSTEMS CO,. LTD., Olympus has established an AI diagnostic support system at a major medical institution, the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology AIG based in Hyderabad, India. Specialist lecturers and physicians from Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital provided expert guidance to AIG doctors. In addition to training AIG doctors in techniques for detecting diseases and differential diagnosis by colonoscope, they also trained the doctors on how to instruct the next generation of endoscopists. The project started on October 12. At the kickoff meeting, Satoshi Hemmi, Deputy DirectorGeneral of the Information and Communications Bureau, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications commented, We hope to contribute to the spread of AI endoscopy systems and the development of medical care in India through training future leaders in AI endoscopy systems in India. We also hope that the cooperation between India and Japan in the field of healthcare ICT will continue to develop. In addition to the ultramagnifying scope Endocyto1 released last year, Olympus will release endoscopic diagnostic support software equipped with AI in India from December. The endoscopic diagnostic support software EndoBRAIN2 and EndoBRAINEYE3 will be utilized for physician training in India. Olympus intends to assist in the development of physicians and promote the use of endoscopic diagnostics. 1 An endoscope that enables observation at the cellular level in real time with up to 520 times optical magnification.2 AI realtime invivo analysis of colon lesions taken with ultrahigh magnifying endoscopes, numerically indicating the possibility of neoplastic and nonneoplastic polyps to assist physicians in the differentiation and detection of polyps through figures.3 AI endoscopic diagnostic imaging support software that assists physicians in diagnosing lesions by alerting if a polyp or other lesion is detected using regular colonoscope images.Background of Olympus Participation In India, the rate of cancer morbidity is expected to increase as the economy grows. On the other hand, there is a severe shortage of doctors who can conduct precision diagnostics with endoscopes, which are essential for early detection and treatment of cancer. Olympus participated in this project to support trained AIG specialists to train doctors in India and neighboring countries and to contribute to the popularization and development of endoscope diagnostics using the latest AI technology. Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications ProjectPurpose:The MIC aims to realize the sustainable development goal and SDG pledges to ensure no one will be left behind. To this end, the MIC aims to realize a model that contributes to SDG through digitization and to disseminate and promote an SDGICT model domestically and overseas between both public and private sectors. This project aims to contribute to the introduction and dissemination of Japans endoscopic AI diagnostic support system to India and neighboring countries in response to the social issue of increasing cancer prevalence in India.Projects:1 Survey on the Current Status of Policies in the Medical Health Sector in India and the Current Status of the Introduction of Medical ICT in India:Collecting information from major medical institutions and external research institutions and investigating the spread of medical systems, including endoscopic systems. 2 Verification through proofofconcept tests in India:Physicians from the Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital will train AIG physicians, from the detection of disease utilizing a colonoscope to discriminatory diagnosis, and train them as lecturers to train instructors. MIC provided equipment and training courses.

Free PDFAustralias encryption laws: An insiders guideAustralia now has worldfirst encryption laws. This guide explains what the laws can do, what they cannot do, and how Australia ended up here. Read More In response to questions taken on notice by deputy commissioner Karl Kent, the AFP said while it did not adopt the facial recognition platform Clearview AI as an enterprise product and had not entered into any formal procurement arrangements with the company, it did use a trial version.The AFPled Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation ACCCE registered for a free trial of the Clearview AI facial recognition tool and conducted a pilot of the system from 2 November 2019 to 22 January 2020.The trial was to assess the capability of the Clearview AI system in the context of countering child exploitation, the AFP wrote.See also: Facial recognition: Convenient or creepy The trial saw nine invitations sent from Clearview AI to AFP officers to register for a free trial, with seven officers activating the trial and conducting searches. These searches included images of known individuals, and unknown individuals related to current or past investigations relating to child exploitation, it said. Outside of the ACCCE Operational Command there was no visibility that this trial had commenced. In response to three requests for information sought under Australias Freedom of Information Act 1982, the AFP said there were no cases of it using Clearview AI.Last month, Kent told a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security PJCIS, as part of its review of the countrys mandatory data retention regime, that he had received advice from his legal team on the matter and that they needed to do some further digging.The requests were processed in accordance with the FOI Act, in that reasonable searches were undertaken by the AFP portfolio with responsibility for facial identification capabilities. No information relating to Clearview AI was identified, the AFP wrote in response.It was subsequently discoveredthe AFPhosted Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation ACCCE held information relevant to Clearview AI, which was not identified in response to the earlier freedom of information requests.With Clearview AI in February suffering a data breach that exposed its customer list, the number of accounts each customer has, and the number of searches those customers have made, the federal opposition has asked Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton to explain whether the use of Clearview AI without legal authorisation has jeopardised AFP investigations into child exploitation. It also asked Dutton whether he could ensure that no Australians have had their privacy breached as a result of the use of Clearview AI by AFP officers.Peter Dutton must immediately explain what knowledge he had of Australian Federal Police officers using the Clearview AI facial recognition tool despite the absence of any legislative framework in relation to the use of identitymatching services, a statement from Labor said.See also: Committee orders complete redrafting of Biometric Bills as privacy safeguards are deemed inadequateClearview AI, founded by Australian entrepreneur Hoan TonThat, also faced criticism last month from Australian Privacy Commissioner Angelene Falk, who hadmade inquiriesto determine if the data of Australians had been collected.Meanwhile, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner OAIC has issued a notice to produce under section 44 of the Privacy Act in relation to Clearview AI.The AFP is continuing to review this matter internally. It is our understanding that, accepting the limited pilot outlined above, that no other areas or individuals have utilised the Clearview AI product or engaged with the company, AFP said in response to questions on notice.The AFP is fully cooperating with the OAIC and is continuing to review and evaluate our governance and policy setting in this space. The AFP seeks to balance the privacy, ethical and legal challenges of new technology with its potential to solve crime and even save victims. We are actively looking to improve our processes and governance without necessarily constraining innovative investigative approaches.RELATED COVERAGEAustralian Federal Police calls for audit into its telco data requestsData breach exposes Clearview AI client listFacial recognition could be most invasive policing technology ever, warns watchdog Related Topics:AustraliaSecurity TVData ManagementCXOData CentersByAsha BarbaschowApril 15, 202003:40 GMT 20:40 PDTTopic: SecurityShow CommentsLOG IN TO COMMENT My Profile Log OutCommunity Guidelines Join Discussion Add Your Comment Add Your Comment More from Asha Barbaschow Innovation Eftpos digital identity trial coming soon Innovation Industry body wants RD Tax entive Bill pulled in the wake of COVID19 Security Ombudsman seeks more funding to cope with international production orders Bill Innovation Nearly 23 million Aussies have a My Health Record, but only 13 million are using it Please review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription.

Heres a shortlist of technologies and processes that can support this transition, and what they are about.ByGeorge Anadiotisfor Big on DataDecember 22, 202013:00 GMT 05:00 PSTTopic: Innovation These past few months have not been kind to any of us. The ripples caused by the COVID19 crisis are felt far and wide, and the worlds economies have taken a staggering blow. As with most things in life, however, this crisis has also brought some interesting side effects.Special featureDigital Transformation: A CXOs GuideReimagining business for the digital age is the numberone priority for many of todays top executives. We offer practical advice and examples of how to do it right. Read More The way to cope for practically every one of us, including organizations of all sizes and shapes, can be summarized in one infamous buzzword: digital transformation. This can mean different things depending on who you ask, from video calls and remote collaboration apps to more software as a service, cloud and machine learning investment. Also: Digital transformation: The difference between success and failure Whatever digital transformation means, as the aphorism by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella went, the COVID19 crisis brought years worth of digital transformation in months. Those who had strategically invested are reaping the benefits, those who did not are either out of the game or left with a patchwork of disparate initiatives and apps in place. Theres one thing in common however, regardless of which part in that journey youre at: as digital transformation accelerates, an increasing part of all business activity is leaving its footprint behind in the form of data. Eventually, every employee, customer and supplier interaction, every lead, every information bit and every process, will either take place digitally or be documented digitally. What this means in turn is that in theory, it should be possible to not just derive insights, as the promise of big data and analytics has been, but to go from data to information, and from information to knowledge. Yes, this does sound a lot like the journey towards the fourth industrial revolution, and the promise of artificial intelligence. In the near future, organizations will be datadriven, and the economy will be knowledgebased. Heres a shortlist of technologies and processes that can support it, and what they are about.The data pyramid: from data to knowledgeThe representation of the relationships among data, information, knowledge andultimatelywisdom, known as the data pyramid, has long been part of the language of information science. In the new knowledgebased digital world, encoding and making use of business and operational knowledge is the key to making progress and staying competitive. The representation of the relationships among data, information, knowledge and ultimately wisdom, known as thedata pyramid, has long been part of the language of information scienceSo how do we go from data to information, and from information to knowledge Data is a collection of facts in a raw or unorganized form, such as numbers or characters. Without context, data does not mean much. For example, 18122020 is just a sequence of numbers. But if we define this sequence as a date in the DDMMYYY format, we can then interpret it as the 18th of December, 2020. With this added context, the numbers acquire a meaning. Information is data that has been processed in a way that makes it easier to measure, visualize and analyzefor a specific purpose. For example, we can organize our data in a way that exposes relationships between various seemingly disparate and disconnected data points. We can analyze the performance of the Dow Jones index by creating a graph of data points for a particular period of time, based on the data at each days closing. Knowledge is information that has been processed, organized and structured in some way, applied or put into action. For example, by capturing and expressing the meaning of relationships pertaining to our data points, we can automate insights, and extract new knowledge. A knowledge graph of semantic relationships can help explain how certain stocks influence the Dow Jones index, and how different events may affect their prices. Adding context to data turns it to information. Processing information turns it to knowledge. The keys to these transformations are connections and metadata. But there is another wellknown progression at play here. By now, the classification of various forms of analytics from simple to advanced is also well known and understood. The theory behind this classification is that the more advanced forms of analytics lead to AI. Of course, there is an implicit question there: what do we talk about, when we talk about AIAccording to todays conventional wisdom, the answer is machine learning, or more specifically even, deep learning. That has not always been held as a selfevident truth, however. It probably wont be held as such for ever either. And it certainly is not held as such for everyone.For a brief introduction to a more holistic view on AI, and a strong dose of inspiration, we recommend our recent conversation with AI prodigy Gary Marcus. From our part, lets try to approach the analytics progression from a different viewpoint, focusing on a specific data structure: graphs.Graph Analytics What is the optimal way to go through a number of bridges The history of graph theory is linked to this question. The bridges in question were the bridges of Knigsberg. The year was 1736. And the person who formulated a model to answer this question was Leonhard Euler. Euler was a Swiss scientist and engineer, and much of his work is foundational to modern science. Eulers solution on the bridges of Knigsberg is the basis of graph theory. There is a line connecting Euler to modern data science. What Euler did was to model the bridges and the paths connecting them as nodes and edges in a graph. Euler formalized the relationships between nodes and edges. That formed the basis for many graph algorithms that can tackle problems such as the bridges of Knigsberg. In the new knowledgebased digital world, encoding and making use of business and operational knowledge is the key to making progress and staying competitive.The most famous graph algorithm is probably PageRank the foundation of Googles empire. PageRank models documents on the web as a graph, and uses links among them to derive relevance for a specific query. But Googles success with PageRank is just the tip of the iceberg. From the 18th century to today, a number of graph algorithms have been developed. Path finding, centrality, community detection and similarity are some of the main classes of graph algorithms. Graph algorithms have many applications in data analytics. From eBay and NASA to investigative journalists and independent data scientists, graph analytics power realworld use cases and make a difference every day in areas of recommendations and fraud detection to network analysis and natural language processing. This is why the analyst firm Gartner predicts that graph analytics will grow in the next few years due to the need to ask complex questions across complex data.Graph Databases Leveraging connections in data is a prominent way of getting value out of data. Graph is the best way of leveraging connections, and graph databases excel at this. Graph databases make expressing and querying connection easy and powerful.This is why graph databases are a good match in use cases that require leveraging connections in data: Antifraud, Recommendations, Customer 360 or Master Data Management. From operational applications to analytics, and from data integration to machine learning, graph gives you an edge. There is a difference between graph analytics and graph databases. Graph analytics can be performed on any back end, as they only require reading graphshaped data. Graph databases are databases with the ability to fully support both read and write, utilizing a graph data model, API and query language. Graph databases have been around for a long time, but the attention they have been getting since 2017 is off the charts. AWS and Microsoft moving in the domain, with Neptune and Cosmos DB respectively, exposed graph databases to a wider audience. This hitherto niche domain has been the hottest in data management since then. Besides trends, however, there are real reasons why graph databases are interesting, and real use cases they can help with. To quote Gartner again: The application of graph processing and graph DBMSs will grow at 100 percent annually through 2022 to continuously accelerate data preparation and enable more complex and adaptive data science. Graph data stores can efficiently model, explore and query data with complex interrelationships across data silos.Knowledge GraphsConnecting data silos is a prerequisite for knowledge management, and knowledge graphs excel at this. Knowledge graphs are a specific subclass of graphs, also known as semantic graphs. They come with metadata, schema, global identifier, and reasoning capabilities, which makes them ideal for capturing and managing knowledge. Its understandable why many people tend to think of graph as a new technology. The truth, however, is this technology is at least 20 years old. It has been largely initiated by none other than Tim BernersLee, who is also credited as the inventor of the Web. BernersLee published his Semantic Web manifesto in 2001. Although sidelined over the years, these principles and technology are still largely behind the Knowledge Graph renaissance. Google played a key role in the rise of graphs, and knowledge graphs. As the web itself is a prime use case for graphs, PageRank was born. Gartner has included knowledge graphs in its 2020 hype cycle for AI, at the peak of inflated expectationsDespite PageRanks success, crawling and categorizing content on the web is a very hard problem to solve without semantics and metadata. Hence Google embraced semantic technology, and coined the term Knowledge Graph in 2012. This, and the widespread adoption ofthat followed, marked the beginning of the meteoric rise of graph technology and knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs can address key challenges such as data governance and data integration. Ultimately, knowledge graphs can serve as the digital substrate to unify the philosophy of knowledge acquisition and organization with the practice of data management in the digital age. And ontologies, the elaborate schemas that govern knowledge graphs, are now being used by the Morgan Stanleys of the world.Graphs, AI, and natural language processing You would be tempted to think that knowledge graphs are the end all for capturing and managing knowledge you would be wrong. Knowledge graphs excel in capturing knowledge explicitly, in a topdown way. Knowledge graphs are part of AI, the socalled good old AI, or symbolic AI. This is why Gartner has included knowledge graphs in its 2020 hype cycle for AI, at the peak of inflated expectations, no less. Knowledge graphs and ontologies may fare better than any other technology for managing explicit, a priori knowledge, but what about implicit, emergent, evolving knowledge This is where machine learning works well, but here, too, graphs may have a helping hand to lend. What does graph have to do with machine learning A lot, actually. And it goes both ways. Machine learning can help bootstrap and populate knowledge graphs. The information contained in graphs can boost the efficiency of machine learning approaches. What does graph have to do with machine learning A lot, actually. And it goes both ways. Image: OracleMachine learning, and its deep learning subdomain, make a great match for graphs. Machine learning on graphs is still a nascent technology, but one which is full of promise. Amazon, Alibaba, Apple, Facebook and Twitter are just some of the organizations using this in production, and advancing the state of the art. More than 25 of the research published in top AI conferences is graphrelated. Last but not least, according to Facebook AI researcher Fabio Petroni, graphs may not be the best way to obtain knowledge: As human beings, we already invented the best way of representing knowledgetext. With recent advances in Natural Language Processing NLP, we now have machines that can retrieve pieces of context, reason on top of that and solve knowledge intensive tasks without using a knowledge base, just using text and understanding text.Having come full circle, this reference points to the kind of holistic approach to AI, knowledge representation and reasoning that Gary Marcus vision lays out. We have been keeping track of this field, and will continue to do so and report back here.Featured ZDNet Recommends: Holiday Gift Guide 2020 The best 3D printers for business and home use What is machine learning Everything you need to know Stay safe online: The best VPNs Related Topics:Big Data AnalyticsCXODigital TransformationTech IndustrySmart CitiesCloudByGeorge Anadiotisfor Big on DataDecember 22, 202013:00 GMT 05:00 PSTTopic: InnovationShow CommentsLOG IN TO COMMENT My Profile Log OutCommunity Guidelines Join Discussion Add Your Comment Add Your Comment More from George Anadiotis Big Data Analytics Lightningfast Python for 100x faster performance from Saturn Cloud, now available on Snowflake Artificial Intelligence Trailblaizing endtoend AI application development for the edge: Blaize releases AI Studio Data Management Meet Stargate, DataStaxs GraphQL for databases.

It also gives investors a sense of what the product can achieve with scale. But, it is important to build the MVP frugally. Heres how BeatO, the Delhibased healthcare startup, did it. 0 claps0 Share on0 claps0 Share onShare onBeing diabetic themselves, Yash Sehgal and Gautam Chopra realised the need for a platform that could give them the insights and information on how well they could manage their blood sugar levels.The duo had an initial hypothesis: for people who monitor their sugar levelsa personalised interpretation of their sugar level readings, along with a realtime interventionwould be very useful in making a positive impact in their blood glucose values.This led them to start the fullstack healthtech platform BeatO in 2015, which provides information and products for diabetes management. With a focus on chronic illness management in India, the startup has over 100,000 users on its platform, adding close to 10,0000 users each month.BeatO provides diabetic patients with a smartphone glucometer and app, which connects them with inhouse specialists, helps share and analyse readings, track fitness levels, and manage diet with a range of diabeticfriendly food products. BeatOs platform has now evolved to track chronic illnesses as well. ALSO READ YS Learn From cofounders turning security guards to reaching 2 million homes, the MVP journey of MyGate Start smallIn the beginning, the cofounders focussed on their hypothesis and made a simple app, where users could manually fill in their readings. If the readings were beyond the appropriate range, the inhouse specialist diabetes educators would immediately assist a call to provide insights to the user.We were happy with the initial user engagement and feedback. We received appreciation for these interventions when it was of the utmost importance. However, there was other learning that we felt was needed in the process to make the product more appealing to our users, says Gautam.Firstly, they needed to solve the problem of data acquisition as most users did not want to feed the data in manually. The startup solved this successfully through its smartphoneconnected glucometer device.Secondly, while diabetes educators could call people, we needed a more intelligent system to triage users, and provide more contextualised, personalised actions. This overtime gave birth to HealthNeuronBeatOs AI engine, explains Gautam.Keep evolvingThe cofounder explains that the product has to be everevolving. As more customers started using the startups platform, several rich insights started to come in, many of which were built into the product. BeatOs product team works very closely with the customer experience team to understand various areas of improvement, as well as areas of further product evolution.By having our ears close to the ground and seeking active feedback and response from our users, we introduce features based on data and the rich insights we gather. There is a balance in the thought process that founders need to strike. As an MVP, it should focus on learning about consumers interest in the product rather than in earnings. Also, at times, there is a tendency to add many features, thereby losing sight of the core valuethis can lead to overinvestment by an already capitalstarved startup, explains Gautam. ALSO READ YS Learn Heres how founders can master business strategy with five top moves Be nimble and look at dataBeatO cofounders, fairly early into the operations, also concluded that the performance of their product will be based on the data and user feedback.However, to improve and commercialise the product, at times, it may take more time than one envisages. For this, we now try to evaluate what is the effort versus the impact the product will have in the short, mid, or long term, and then decide how we wish to include the product evolution in our pipeline, says Gautam.Keep the focus sharpAccording to Gautam, the team at BeatO focusses on two things Opportunity arising out of a new or evolving market situation: For example, the COVID19 pandemic has provided a unique opportunity for the startup to launch its Virtual Endocrine Clinic, as well as its Diabetes Total Insurance Subscription feature, as both became critical user needs overnight.An outcome of what data tells us: For example, BeatO realised that people responded favourably to compliancebased rewards. In fact, it built this feature, where it demonstrates a great relationship with health economics and health outcomes.Focus on tech, but not over consumer needsFor any startup, during the MVP phase, having a significant focus on learning and observing customers actual behaviour with the product is more important than the tech architecture.The core architecture of the system should be built around the primary offering and should be flexible enough to evolve as new offerings are in place, Gautam says. If a Chief Product Officer CFO is confident that an MVP needs to be commercialised, having a solid core team that drives the tech architecture, early team hiring, and optimising costs can be paramount.The simplest way to manage the architecture is to build small, but think big. This will make the system futureready, and will always have the possibility of enhancements to be added when the time comes, he adds.Advising CPOs, Gautam says, Try getting to the root of the real problem that your product has to solve.Edited by Suman Singh Indias most prolific entrepreneurship conference TechSparks is back With it comes an opportunity for earlystage startups to scale and succeed.

for electronic toll collection ETC newly set up at a roadside parking space on Yangzhuang road, Shijingshan district, Beijing. Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July 1, 2019. Peoples Daily OnlineLi WenmingThanks to the application of an artificial intelligence AIempowered roadside electronic toll collection ETC system, Chinas capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.As the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding 90 percent.With the AIempowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time, recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.Since the summer of 2019, roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider, Wang said.The smart roadside ETC system AIpark Sky Eye adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijingbased leading smart parking solution provider.The companys intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the countrys innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in 2018 by Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology MIIT.Traditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.Such problems dont exist in smart machines. The AIpark Sky Eye system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.Each set of cameras of the AIpark Sky Eye system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for 24 hours a day. The data collected by frontend cameras are processed using multidimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.The most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by highmounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes.For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians, Xiang said.Once the highmounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the AIpark Sky Eye system.Besides managing parking fee collection, highmounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.So far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than 20 cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking industry. 123 Photos Naval fleet steams in East China Sea Newborn golden snubnosed monkey makes debut In pics: birds across China Grain painting studio helps villagers to increase income Related Stories Exhibition highlighting artscience integration opens in BeijingChinas AI industry poised to enter boom timesAlibaba outlines 10 technology trends for 2019Chinas leading AI enterprise iFlytek to develop health information technologyCheetah Mobile wades into artificial intelligenceChina overtakes the US in investment in AI5 million artificial intelligence talents urgently needed in ChinaGraduate students give voice to sign languageArtificial Intelligence in real livesMicrosoft embraces artificial intelligence About Peoples Daily OnlineJoin UsUs2021 Peoples Daily Online. .   \n",

2020Levi Strauss marks the next phase in corporate paid leave policiesFebruary 27, 2020Scientists who designed an artificially clever robotic that helped youngsters with autism spice up their studying and social talents hope such era may just in the future help others with the developmental dysfunction. The learn about noticed seven youngsters with gentle to average autism take domestic whats referred to as a socially assistive robotic, named Kiwi, for a month. According to a commentary by way of the University of Southern California the place the crew is primarily based, the members from the Los Angeles house had been elderly between 3 and seven years previous, and performed spacethemed video games with the robotic virtually day by day. As Kiwi was once fitted with machinelearning era, it was once in a position to offer distinctive comments and directions to the kids in accordance with their talents. For example, if the kid were given a query incorrect Kiwi would give activates to assist them resolve it, and tweak the trouble ranges to problem the kid correctly. The authors of the paper revealed within the magazine Science Robotics discovered all the youngsters noticed their reasoning talents support. Some 92had higher social talents after enjoying with Kiwi for a month, in keeping with the commentary. Cameras hooked as much as Kiwi enabled the crew to additionally observe how engaged the children had been with the robotic, in accordance with the place their eyes had been taking a look, the placement in their heads, their speech and how smartly they carried out on a role. The crew discovered engagement ranged from 48 to 84on reasonable a few of the members, and Kiwi was once in a position to stumble on a disengaged kid with 90accuracy. That was once in spite of possible distractions akin to domestic home equipment, in addition to buddies and circle of relatives. The crew discovered members had been maximum engaged in an instant after the robotic had spoken, however this went down if the space lasted longer than a minute. Lead writer Shomik Jain, advised Newsweek the kids changed into much less engaged because the month went on.Examples of child behavior during these disengaged periods included playing with toys, interacting with siblings, and even abruptly leaving the intervention setting. This served as a motivation for our work, which created models that could be used for realtime recognition and response to disengagement in order to reengage the child to continue with the educational andor therapeutic activity, he stated. From left to proper, lead writer Shomik Jain with coauthors Kartik Mahajan and Zhonghao Shi, all scholars in Professor Maja Mataris interplay lab, with Kiwi the socially assistive robotic. Haotian mai Around one in 59 youngsters within the U.S. have autism, in keeping with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People with the situation, often referred to as autism spectrum dysfunction ASD, can to find it difficult to keep in touch and engage in the similar manner as neurotypical other folks. While therapists may give individualized products and services that assist to show such youngsters social talents, now not everybody can have the funds for this, the crew stated. As such, they sought after to discover the potential for plugging the space with robots. Coauthor Maja Matari Maja J Matari, outstanding professor of pc science, neuroscience, and pediatrics on the University of Southern California advised Newsweek: We and other researchers have been actively exploring SAR socially assistive robotics for children with ASD, because SAR has great potential in supporting the learning of children with ASD. Since we were one of the very few labs that has worked in SAR from its inception, we used our experience over the past 15 years to develop the robot that would meet the needs and interests of children with ASD while being safe and nonthreatening. Jain stated: Currently, robots are restricted of their skill to autonomously acknowledge and reply to human conduct, particularly in ordinary customers and realworld settings akin to houses and colleges. Engaging customers is a key HRI humanrobot interaction capacity in the past unexplored within the context of longterm, inhome SAR interventions for youngsters with ASD. Therefore this learn about is the primary to use mechanical device studying modeling to longterm inhome knowledge with youngsters with ASD.Asked why the kidss engagement and studying stepped forward after interacting with the robotic, Matari stated: The objective of a socially assistive robotic, usually, is to serve within the function of a motivating and supportive spouse. In the particular context of this learn about, the robotic served to inspire the kids to do the maths workouts, and to make stronger them as they had been succeeding or failing throughout the ones workouts.

should be your focus 26 February 2021 ManufacturingProduction Technology, HardwareServices By Willian Santos, international sales manager at ABI Electronics. The world entered a new era of accelerated transformation in the last eighteen months that will continue to evolve and press forward for years to come. Most businesses are playing catchup trying to make sense of a new timeline where the ten years that had been set aside for careful planning and implementation of what was coming up next no longer exists. The next is happening now and, regardless of your industry or seniority, the status quo has shifted and you better face it. Back in 2019, I was invited to attend a pompous meeting in London at the Brazilian Embassy along with selected leading names from the oil and energy industry, to get an update on what was going to happen in the following decade. I could soon spot all the buzzwords coming up on PowerPoint slides from the different companies presenting: decommissioning, decarbonisation, zero emissions, transition to green energy. Throughout the morning and most of the afternoon, we heard that most of these changes would kick in between 203035. And I recall a Shell executive pointing out that the business had explicitly concluded that the current income streams were needed to provide the capital required for the transition to take place in due course.Whomever you talk to in the energy industry in 2021 would tell you to forget about that timeline. Change has come and the transition is happening much faster than anticipated, with big businesses scrambling to find the capital to fund all that is required. I could go on all day talking about how the pandemic and the impact it had on market demand and consumer behaviour messed up the timeline of transport, automotive, defence, manufacturing and so on. For instance, carrier planes that were due to be retired in 2017 are now required to remain in service at least until 2029. Projects in wind power involving upgrades of wind farms have been scrapped and new installations have drawn huge competition from up and coming brands with operators tending to favour smaller turbinesfor being efficient and cheaper to runand choosing to buy from multiple suppliers instead of just one company. Machine learning ML, AI and Industry 4.0 knock at the door. Still, the biggest change yet to be fully appreciated by business leaders is how electronics effectively became the brain of every industrial asset and all infrastructure equipment in operation in recent years, and therefore what is required to deal with breakdowns and obsolescence. For instance, I lost count of the many rail connections that I have working in operations and maintenance who struggle with their CMEchief mechanical engineerwho, like the role suggests, is usually a mechanicallybiased individual who may have a less than ideal approach when it comes to the handling of electronic failures. And you guessed right: less ideal means neither green nor cheap solutions, as illustrated in this video:Many decisionmakers only realise the problem at hand and regret not following the tagon LinkedIn in times like this, resulting in comments like, We did not anticipate that the equipment would become obsolete so quickly or, Spare circuit boards started to take weeks then months to arrive. Then we were told that they would no longer be supplied. We were quoted sevenfigure prices to upgrade our assembly line.By deferring the responsibility to the original equipment supplier and other third parties, you are bound to be caught off guard soon or later. And the risk exposure from insisting on this strategy is about to get exponentially higher there is a widespread component shortage increasing lead times, and technology providers are dropping support for many products in order to remain viable.Last month, a wind turbine multinational in the US had to ship a bunch of expensive controller cards used in inverters and speed governing systems to its workshop in Brazil for repair as new replacement cards are not due back in stock for another six months. Good job that the local team had an electronic diagnostic equipment BoardMaster from ABI in the shop, ready to help the technicians locate the fault and repair the cards, which happened in record time.Poor decisionmaking when it comes to setting maintenance and repair strategies are often linked to fake news and myths such as: A repaired electronic card PCBPCBA will never be as good as a new one. The manufacturer told us that special software was required to troubleshoot the card. Troubleshooting down to the component level is impossible or would take too long. Dedicated test and repair equipment is prohibitively expensive.The mentality here needs to change, and fast. The longer you take to embrace the new strategies for inhouse fault analysis, maintenance, and obsolescence planning of your key electronic circuits and assets, the more expensive it will get to keep them going. Hundreds of leading organisations have found in recent years that the belief in these myths was hindering their results and compromising the operationfrom GE Renewable to Collins Aerospace, where the latter reduced troubleshooting times on avionics circuit cards from 50 hours to 10 minutes. Then there is Lego in Mexico, where controller cards from 600 plastic moulding machines worth tens of thousands of dollars each have been mapped and are now repaired inhouse. In the US, an army engineer saved a mobile shelter unit worth 10 million dollars from being decommissioned by repairing its HVAC circuit board that was deemed irreparable by the OEM. In the rail arena, companies like Alstom, CAF, Bombardier and operators like Irish Rail, SFMTA, TCDD and so many others have discovered the benefits of investing in the right tool and skill development programme to shield the business against parts shortages and accelerated obsolescence. Some of their stories, and the technology that is driving several topshelf global sustainability projects, were the subject of a YouTube series called ABI Labs. The series gives an indepth review of the key tests and techniques available in the Britishmade BoardMaster hardware and software platform from ABI Electronics to handle predictive as well as corrective maintenance of critical electronics without wasting time or money.

Majority of Smartphones BOSTONBUSINESS WIREStrategy Analytics in a newly published report, Smartphones: Global Artificial Intelligence Technologies Forecast to 2025, finds that ondevice Artificial Intelligence AI is being rapidly implemented by smartphone vendors. AI is used in various functions inside smartphones such as intelligent power optimization, imaging, virtual assistants, and to enhance device performance. The report highlights the fact that AI has become the most important technology in modern smartphones. The push to add ondevice AI computational power to enable Edge AI computing is a priority for smartphone and chipset vendors.Strategy Analytics estimates that 71 of all smartphones sold worldwide in 2021 will have ondevice AI, says Associate Director VillePetteri Ukonaho. Advantages of ondevice AI computing include lower latency, better data privacy and overall lower power consumption. An Artificial Intelligence AI smartphone is one that uses an AI coreprocessor designed to run machine learning and deep learning tasks. AI smartphones run AI tasks locally on the device with the help of dedicated AI cores and AI coprocessors with little or no data transmitted to the cloud. Examples of AI smartphones include Apples iPhone 12 Pro Max and Samsungs Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. Artificial Intelligence has become a key technology in higherend smartphones, says Ken Hyers, Director at Strategy Analytics. A smartphone equipped with ondevice AI can significantly improve important tasks like helping users take better pictures, deliver longer battery life through efficient power management, improve the speed of response by digital assistants, and power Augmented Reality, among other tasks. This makes smartphones more useful tools for users. Modern smartphones give consumers access to their own personal AI powered supercomputer, says VillePetteri Ukonaho. With the help of ondevice Artificial Intelligence, virtual assistants like Siri and Googles Assistant have become more intelligent and aware of their environment. Strategy Analytics new report estimates that in 2021 over 80 of smartphones globally will have virtual assistants and the share will grow to 97 by 2025. With the enhanced AI capabilities ondevice, virtual assistants have become more intelligent and aware of their environment, comments Ken Hyers. Strategy Analytics report finds that Googles Assistant is the top virtual assistant in 2021 with over 60 share followed by Apples Siri. Ondevice AI is powered by physical silicon cores such as Apples Neural Engine or distributed software frameworks such as Qualcomm Neural Processing Engine NPE that use algorithms to offload AI computation to several processors CPU, GPU and DSP. Physical AI cores have greater capability to handle complex AI computations, thus those are being introduced by all major chip vendors such as Mediatek, Samsung and HiSilicon, says VillePetteri Ukonaho. Camera AI has become one of the key selling points of imaging focused smartphones, says Ken Hyers and continues, Artificial Intelligence features such as object recognition or motion detection are becoming growingly important in premium smartphones. In the report Strategy Analytics concludes that over 30 of smartphones already have AI enhanced camera functionalities. Strategy Analytics finds in its latest report that technologies such as 5G will greatly benefit from the new capabilities improved by AI and vice versa.

Netfor:Home2020OctoberOlympus to Support Endoscopic AI Diagnosis Education for Doctors in India and to Launch AI Diagnostic Support ApplicationNewsOlympus to Support Endoscopic AI Diagnosis Education for Doctors in India and to Launch AI Diagnostic Support ApplicationTOKYO, Oct 20, 2020ACN NewswireOlympus Corporation took part in a groundbreaking project as a business promoter, in cooperation with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications MIC, entitled, Survey Study for International Expansion of AI Diagnosis Support System Using UltraHigh Magnifying Endoscopes in India. The project aims to develop advanced endoscopy diagnostics in India, where there are relatively few endoscopists. In collaboration with CYBERNET SYSTEMS CO,. LTD., Olympus has established an AI diagnostic support system at a major medical institution, the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology AIG based in Hyderabad, India. Specialist lecturers and physicians from Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital provided expert guidance to AIG doctors. In addition to training AIG doctors in techniques for detecting diseases and differential diagnosis by colonoscope, they also trained the doctors on how to instruct the next generation of endoscopists. The project started on October 12. At the kickoff meeting, Satoshi Hemmi, Deputy DirectorGeneral of the Information and Communications Bureau, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications commented, We hope to contribute to the spread of AI endoscopy systems and the development of medical care in India through training future leaders in AI endoscopy systems in India. We also hope that the cooperation between India and Japan in the field of healthcare ICT will continue to develop. In addition to the ultramagnifying scope Endocyto1 released last year, Olympus will release endoscopic diagnostic support software equipped with AI in India from December. The endoscopic diagnostic support software EndoBRAIN2 and EndoBRAINEYE3 will be utilized for physician training in India. Olympus intends to assist in the development of physicians and promote the use of endoscopic diagnostics. 1 An endoscope that enables observation at the cellular level in real time with up to 520 times optical magnification.2 AI realtime invivo analysis of colon lesions taken with ultrahigh magnifying endoscopes, numerically indicating the possibility of neoplastic and nonneoplastic polyps to assist physicians in the differentiation and detection of polyps through figures.3 AI endoscopic diagnostic imaging support software that assists physicians in diagnosing lesions by alerting if a polyp or other lesion is detected using regular colonoscope images.Background of Olympus Participation In India, the rate of cancer morbidity is expected to increase as the economy grows. On the other hand, there is a severe shortage of doctors who can conduct precision diagnostics with endoscopes, which are essential for early detection and treatment of cancer. Olympus participated in this project to support trained AIG specialists to train doctors in India and neighboring countries and to contribute to the popularization and development of endoscope diagnostics using the latest AI technology. Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications ProjectPurpose:The MIC aims to realize the sustainable development goal and SDG pledges to ensure no one will be left behind. To this end, the MIC aims to realize a model that contributes to SDG through digitization and to disseminate and promote an SDGICT model domestically and overseas between both public and private sectors. This project aims to contribute to the introduction and dissemination of Japans endoscopic AI diagnostic support system to India and neighboring countries in response to the social issue of increasing cancer prevalence in India.Projects:1 Survey on the Current Status of Policies in the Medical Health Sector in India and the Current Status of the Introduction of Medical ICT in India:Collecting information from major medical institutions and external research institutions and investigating the spread of medical systems, including endoscopic systems. 2 Verification through proofofconcept tests in India:Physicians from the Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital will train AIG physicians, from the detection of disease utilizing a colonoscope to discriminatory diagnosis, and train them as lecturers to train instructors. MIC provided equipment and training courses.

Clearview AI facial recognition platform.ByAsha BarbaschowApril 15, 202003:40 GMT 20:40 PDTTopic: SecurityThe Australian Federal Police AFP has admitted to using a facial recognition tool, despite not having an appropriate legislative framework in place, to help counter child exploitation. Free PDFAustralias encryption laws: An insiders guideAustralia now has worldfirst encryption laws. This guide explains what the laws can do, what they cannot do, and how Australia ended up here. Read More In response to questions taken on notice by deputy commissioner Karl Kent, the AFP said while it did not adopt the facial recognition platform Clearview AI as an enterprise product and had not entered into any formal procurement arrangements with the company, it did use a trial version.The AFPled Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation ACCCE registered for a free trial of the Clearview AI facial recognition tool and conducted a pilot of the system from 2 November 2019 to 22 January 2020.The trial was to assess the capability of the Clearview AI system in the context of countering child exploitation, the AFP wrote.See also: Facial recognition: Convenient or creepy The trial saw nine invitations sent from Clearview AI to AFP officers to register for a free trial, with seven officers activating the trial and conducting searches. These searches included images of known individuals, and unknown individuals related to current or past investigations relating to child exploitation, it said. Outside of the ACCCE Operational Command there was no visibility that this trial had commenced. In response to three requests for information sought under Australias Freedom of Information Act 1982, the AFP said there were no cases of it using Clearview AI.Last month, Kent told a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security PJCIS, as part of its review of the countrys mandatory data retention regime, that he had received advice from his legal team on the matter and that they needed to do some further digging.The requests were processed in accordance with the FOI Act, in that reasonable searches were undertaken by the AFP portfolio with responsibility for facial identification capabilities. No information relating to Clearview AI was identified, the AFP wrote in response.It was subsequently discoveredthe AFPhosted Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation ACCCE held information relevant to Clearview AI, which was not identified in response to the earlier freedom of information requests.With Clearview AI in February suffering a data breach that exposed its customer list, the number of accounts each customer has, and the number of searches those customers have made, the federal opposition has asked Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton to explain whether the use of Clearview AI without legal authorisation has jeopardised AFP investigations into child exploitation. It also asked Dutton whether he could ensure that no Australians have had their privacy breached as a result of the use of Clearview AI by AFP officers.Peter Dutton must immediately explain what knowledge he had of Australian Federal Police officers using the Clearview AI facial recognition tool despite the absence of any legislative framework in relation to the use of identitymatching services, a statement from Labor said.See also: Committee orders complete redrafting of Biometric Bills as privacy safeguards are deemed inadequateClearview AI, founded by Australian entrepreneur Hoan TonThat, also faced criticism last month from Australian Privacy Commissioner Angelene Falk, who hadmade inquiriesto determine if the data of Australians had been collected.Meanwhile, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner OAIC has issued a notice to produce under section 44 of the Privacy Act in relation to Clearview AI.The AFP is continuing to review this matter internally. It is our understanding that, accepting the limited pilot outlined above, that no other areas or individuals have utilised the Clearview AI product or engaged with the company, AFP said in response to questions on notice.The AFP is fully cooperating with the OAIC and is continuing to review and evaluate our governance and policy setting in this space. The AFP seeks to balance the privacy, ethical and legal challenges of new technology with its potential to solve crime and even save victims. We are actively looking to improve our processes and governance without necessarily constraining innovative investigative approaches.RELATED COVERAGEAustralian Federal Police calls for audit into its telco data requestsData breach exposes Clearview AI client listFacial recognition could be most invasive policing technology ever, warns watchdog Related Topics:AustraliaSecurity TVData ManagementCXOData CentersByAsha BarbaschowApril 15, 202003:40 GMT 20:40 PDTTopic: SecurityShow CommentsLOG IN TO COMMENT My Profile Log OutCommunity Guidelines Join Discussion Add Your Comment Add Your Comment More from Asha Barbaschow Innovation Eftpos digital identity trial coming soon Innovation Industry body wants RD Tax entive Bill pulled in the wake of COVID19 Security Ombudsman seeks more funding to cope with international production orders Bill Innovation Nearly 23 million Aussies have a My Health Record, but only 13 million are using it Please review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription.

Heres a shortlist of technologies and processes that can support this transition, and what they are about.ByGeorge Anadiotisfor Big on DataDecember 22, 202013:00 GMT 05:00 PSTTopic: Innovation These past few months have not been kind to any of us. The ripples caused by the COVID19 crisis are felt far and wide, and the worlds economies have taken a staggering blow. As with most things in life, however, this crisis has also brought some interesting side effects.Special featureDigital Transformation: A CXOs GuideReimagining business for the digital age is the numberone priority for many of todays top executives. We offer practical advice and examples of how to do it right. Read More The way to cope for practically every one of us, including organizations of all sizes and shapes, can be summarized in one infamous buzzword: digital transformation. This can mean different things depending on who you ask, from video calls and remote collaboration apps to more software as a service, cloud and machine learning investment. Also: Digital transformation: The difference between success and failure Whatever digital transformation means, as the aphorism by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella went, the COVID19 crisis brought years worth of digital transformation in months. Those who had strategically invested are reaping the benefits, those who did not are either out of the game or left with a patchwork of disparate initiatives and apps in place. Theres one thing in common however, regardless of which part in that journey youre at: as digital transformation accelerates, an increasing part of all business activity is leaving its footprint behind in the form of data. Eventually, every employee, customer and supplier interaction, every lead, every information bit and every process, will either take place digitally or be documented digitally. What this means in turn is that in theory, it should be possible to not just derive insights, as the promise of big data and analytics has been, but to go from data to information, and from information to knowledge. Yes, this does sound a lot like the journey towards the fourth industrial revolution, and the promise of artificial intelligence. In the near future, organizations will be datadriven, and the economy will be knowledgebased. Heres a shortlist of technologies and processes that can support it, and what they are about.The data pyramid: from data to knowledgeThe representation of the relationships among data, information, knowledge andultimatelywisdom, known as the data pyramid, has long been part of the language of information science. In the new knowledgebased digital world, encoding and making use of business and operational knowledge is the key to making progress and staying competitive. The representation of the relationships among data, information, knowledge and ultimately wisdom, known as thedata pyramid, has long been part of the language of information scienceSo how do we go from data to information, and from information to knowledge Data is a collection of facts in a raw or unorganized form, such as numbers or characters. Without context, data does not mean much. For example, 18122020 is just a sequence of numbers. But if we define this sequence as a date in the DDMMYYY format, we can then interpret it as the 18th of December, 2020. With this added context, the numbers acquire a meaning. Information is data that has been processed in a way that makes it easier to measure, visualize and analyzefor a specific purpose. For example, we can organize our data in a way that exposes relationships between various seemingly disparate and disconnected data points. We can analyze the performance of the Dow Jones index by creating a graph of data points for a particular period of time, based on the data at each days closing. Knowledge is information that has been processed, organized and structured in some way, applied or put into action. For example, by capturing and expressing the meaning of relationships pertaining to our data points, we can automate insights, and extract new knowledge. A knowledge graph of semantic relationships can help explain how certain stocks influence the Dow Jones index, and how different events may affect their prices. Adding context to data turns it to information. Processing information turns it to knowledge. The keys to these transformations are connections and metadata. But there is another wellknown progression at play here. By now, the classification of various forms of analytics from simple to advanced is also well known and understood. The theory behind this classification is that the more advanced forms of analytics lead to AI. Of course, there is an implicit question there: what do we talk about, when we talk about AIAccording to todays conventional wisdom, the answer is machine learning, or more specifically even, deep learning. That has not always been held as a selfevident truth, however. It probably wont be held as such for ever either. And it certainly is not held as such for everyone.For a brief introduction to a more holistic view on AI, and a strong dose of inspiration, we recommend our recent conversation with AI prodigy Gary Marcus. From our part, lets try to approach the analytics progression from a different viewpoint, focusing on a specific data structure: graphs.Graph Analytics What is the optimal way to go through a number of bridges The history of graph theory is linked to this question. The bridges in question were the bridges of Knigsberg. The year was 1736. And the person who formulated a model to answer this question was Leonhard Euler. Euler was a Swiss scientist and engineer, and much of his work is foundational to modern science. Eulers solution on the bridges of Knigsberg is the basis of graph theory. There is a line connecting Euler to modern data science. What Euler did was to model the bridges and the paths connecting them as nodes and edges in a graph. Euler formalized the relationships between nodes and edges. That formed the basis for many graph algorithms that can tackle problems such as the bridges of Knigsberg. In the new knowledgebased digital world, encoding and making use of business and operational knowledge is the key to making progress and staying competitive.The most famous graph algorithm is probably PageRank the foundation of Googles empire. PageRank models documents on the web as a graph, and uses links among them to derive relevance for a specific query. But Googles success with PageRank is just the tip of the iceberg. From the 18th century to today, a number of graph algorithms have been developed. Path finding, centrality, community detection and similarity are some of the main classes of graph algorithms. Graph algorithms have many applications in data analytics. From eBay and NASA to investigative journalists and independent data scientists, graph analytics power realworld use cases and make a difference every day in areas of recommendations and fraud detection to network analysis and natural language processing. This is why the analyst firm Gartner predicts that graph analytics will grow in the next few years due to the need to ask complex questions across complex data.Graph Databases Leveraging connections in data is a prominent way of getting value out of data. Graph is the best way of leveraging connections, and graph databases excel at this. Graph databases make expressing and querying connection easy and powerful.This is why graph databases are a good match in use cases that require leveraging connections in data: Antifraud, Recommendations, Customer 360 or Master Data Management. From operational applications to analytics, and from data integration to machine learning, graph gives you an edge. There is a difference between graph analytics and graph databases. Graph analytics can be performed on any back end, as they only require reading graphshaped data. Graph databases are databases with the ability to fully support both read and write, utilizing a graph data model, API and query language. Graph databases have been around for a long time, but the attention they have been getting since 2017 is off the charts. AWS and Microsoft moving in the domain, with Neptune and Cosmos DB respectively, exposed graph databases to a wider audience. This hitherto niche domain has been the hottest in data management since then. Besides trends, however, there are real reasons why graph databases are interesting, and real use cases they can help with. To quote Gartner again: The application of graph processing and graph DBMSs will grow at 100 percent annually through 2022 to continuously accelerate data preparation and enable more complex and adaptive data science. Graph data stores can efficiently model, explore and query data with complex interrelationships across data silos.Knowledge GraphsConnecting data silos is a prerequisite for knowledge management, and knowledge graphs excel at this. Knowledge graphs are a specific subclass of graphs, also known as semantic graphs. They come with metadata, schema, global identifier, and reasoning capabilities, which makes them ideal for capturing and managing knowledge. Its understandable why many people tend to think of graph as a new technology. The truth, however, is this technology is at least 20 years old. It has been largely initiated by none other than Tim BernersLee, who is also credited as the inventor of the Web. BernersLee published his Semantic Web manifesto in 2001. Although sidelined over the years, these principles and technology are still largely behind the Knowledge Graph renaissance. Google played a key role in the rise of graphs, and knowledge graphs. As the web itself is a prime use case for graphs, PageRank was born. Gartner has included knowledge graphs in its 2020 hype cycle for AI, at the peak of inflated expectationsDespite PageRanks success, crawling and categorizing content on the web is a very hard problem to solve without semantics and metadata. Hence Google embraced semantic technology, and coined the term Knowledge Graph in 2012. This, and the widespread adoption ofthat followed, marked the beginning of the meteoric rise of graph technology and knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs can address key challenges such as data governance and data integration. Ultimately, knowledge graphs can serve as the digital substrate to unify the philosophy of knowledge acquisition and organization with the practice of data management in the digital age. And ontologies, the elaborate schemas that govern knowledge graphs, are now being used by the Morgan Stanleys of the world.Graphs, AI, and natural language processing You would be tempted to think that knowledge graphs are the end all for capturing and managing knowledge you would be wrong. Knowledge graphs excel in capturing knowledge explicitly, in a topdown way. Knowledge graphs are part of AI, the socalled good old AI, or symbolic AI. This is why Gartner has included knowledge graphs in its 2020 hype cycle for AI, at the peak of inflated expectations, no less. Knowledge graphs and ontologies may fare better than any other technology for managing explicit, a priori knowledge, but what about implicit, emergent, evolving knowledge This is where machine learning works well, but here, too, graphs may have a helping hand to lend. What does graph have to do with machine learning A lot, actually. And it goes both ways. Machine learning can help bootstrap and populate knowledge graphs. The information contained in graphs can boost the efficiency of machine learning approaches. What does graph have to do with machine learning A lot, actually. And it goes both ways. Image: OracleMachine learning, and its deep learning subdomain, make a great match for graphs. Machine learning on graphs is still a nascent technology, but one which is full of promise. Amazon, Alibaba, Apple, Facebook and Twitter are just some of the organizations using this in production, and advancing the state of the art. More than 25 of the research published in top AI conferences is graphrelated. Last but not least, according to Facebook AI researcher Fabio Petroni, graphs may not be the best way to obtain knowledge: As human beings, we already invented the best way of representing knowledgetext. With recent advances in Natural Language Processing NLP, we now have machines that can retrieve pieces of context, reason on top of that and solve knowledge intensive tasks without using a knowledge base, just using text and understanding text.Having come full circle, this reference points to the kind of holistic approach to AI, knowledge representation and reasoning that Gary Marcus vision lays out. We have been keeping track of this field, and will continue to do so and report back here.Featured ZDNet Recommends: Holiday Gift Guide 2020 The best 3D printers for business and home use What is machine learning Everything you need to know Stay safe online: The best VPNs Related Topics:Big Data AnalyticsCXODigital TransformationTech IndustrySmart CitiesCloudByGeorge Anadiotisfor Big on DataDecember 22, 202013:00 GMT 05:00 PSTTopic: InnovationShow CommentsLOG IN TO COMMENT My Profile Log OutCommunity Guidelines Join Discussion Add Your Comment Add Your Comment More from George Anadiotis Big Data Analytics Lightningfast Python for 100x faster performance from Saturn Cloud, now available on Snowflake Artificial Intelligence Trailblaizing endtoend AI application development for the edge: Blaize releases AI Studio Data Management Meet Stargate, DataStaxs GraphQL for databases.

Learn From helping diabetic patients to managing chronic illness: the journey of BeatOs AI platformBy Sindhu Kashyaap7th Oct 2020The minimum viable product MVP plays a vital role in understanding customer needs. It also gives investors a sense of what the product can achieve with scale. But, it is important to build the MVP frugally. Heres how BeatO, the Delhibased healthcare startup, did it. 0 claps0 Share on0 claps0 Share onShare onBeing diabetic themselves, Yash Sehgal and Gautam Chopra realised the need for a platform that could give them the insights and information on how well they could manage their blood sugar levels.The duo had an initial hypothesis: for people who monitor their sugar levelsa personalised interpretation of their sugar level readings, along with a realtime interventionwould be very useful in making a positive impact in their blood glucose values.This led them to start the fullstack healthtech platform BeatO in 2015, which provides information and products for diabetes management. With a focus on chronic illness management in India, the startup has over 100,000 users on its platform, adding close to 10,0000 users each month.BeatO provides diabetic patients with a smartphone glucometer and app, which connects them with inhouse specialists, helps share and analyse readings, track fitness levels, and manage diet with a range of diabeticfriendly food products. BeatOs platform has now evolved to track chronic illnesses as well.

If the readings were beyond the appropriate range, the inhouse specialist diabetes educators would immediately assist a call to provide insights to the user.We were happy with the initial user engagement and feedback. We received appreciation for these interventions when it was of the utmost importance. However, there was other learning that we felt was needed in the process to make the product more appealing to our users, says Gautam.Firstly, they needed to solve the problem of data acquisition as most users did not want to feed the data in manually. The startup solved this successfully through its smartphoneconnected glucometer device.Secondly, while diabetes educators could call people, we needed a more intelligent system to triage users, and provide more contextualised, personalised actions. This overtime gave birth to HealthNeuronBeatOs AI engine, explains Gautam.Keep evolvingThe cofounder explains that the product has to be everevolving. As more customers started using the startups platform, several rich insights started to come in, many of which were built into the product. BeatOs product team works very closely with the customer experience team to understand various areas of improvement, as well as areas of further product evolution.By having our ears close to the ground and seeking active feedback and response from our users, we introduce features based on data and the rich insights we gather. There is a balance in the thought process that founders need to strike. As an MVP, it should focus on learning about consumers interest in the product rather than in earnings. Also, at times, there is a tendency to add many features, thereby losing sight of the core valuethis can lead to overinvestment by an already capitalstarved startup, explains Gautam. ALSO READ YS Learn Heres how founders can master business strategy with five top moves Be nimble and look at dataBeatO cofounders, fairly early into the operations, also concluded that the performance of their product will be based on the data and user feedback.However, to improve and commercialise the product, at times, it may take more time than one envisages. For this, we now try to evaluate what is the effort versus the impact the product will have in the short, mid, or long term, and then decide how we wish to include the product evolution in our pipeline, says Gautam.Keep the focus sharpAccording to Gautam, the team at BeatO focusses on two things Opportunity arising out of a new or evolving market situation: For example, the COVID19 pandemic has provided a unique opportunity for the startup to launch its Virtual Endocrine Clinic, as well as its Diabetes Total Insurance Subscription feature, as both became critical user needs overnight.An outcome of what data tells us: For example, BeatO realised that people responded favourably to compliancebased rewards. In fact, it built this feature, where it demonstrates a great relationship with health economics and health outcomes.Focus on tech, but not over consumer needsFor any startup, during the MVP phase, having a significant focus on learning and observing customers actual behaviour with the product is more important than the tech architecture.The core architecture of the system should be built around the primary offering and should be flexible enough to evolve as new offerings are in place, Gautam says. If a Chief Product Officer CFO is confident that an MVP needs to be commercialised, having a solid core team that drives the tech architecture, early team hiring, and optimising costs can be paramount.The simplest way to manage the architecture is to build small, but think big. This will make the system futureready, and will always have the possibility of enhancements to be added when the time comes, he adds.Advising CPOs, Gautam says, Try getting to the root of the real problem that your product has to solve.Edited by Suman Singh Indias most prolific entrepreneurship conference TechSparks is back With it comes an opportunity for earlystage startups to scale and succeed.

He said,As Covid now rages through all of India, tracking Covid resources like beds, ICU,plasma, funding, etc., has become very crucial. There are many websites that have now come up to help the common man track them, but they are typically built for the tech population. We wanted to help these websites reach more people by adding a multilingual Voice Assistant on top of them, which would allow users to just talk to these websites and ask what they want and the app can respond accordingly.Get connected to Slang LabsRangarajan said Slang Labs had added a similar voice assistant to a Covid19 dashboard last year, which he claims to have helped. These tools support languages like English, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam, among others, and work for apps as well as website.According to the Indian health ministry data, on Wednesday May 5, 2021, a record 3,780 fresh COVID19 fatalities were registered in a single day in the country, taking the death toll to 2,26,188, while 3,82,315 new coronavirus infections were recorded.
